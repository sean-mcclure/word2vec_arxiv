Abstract
Standard arguments state that Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) cannot occur in dimensions
lower than three in the thermodynamic limit as the expressions for the number of bosons in the
excited states are unbounded. These arguments imply that the number density is infinite, which is
an extraordinary condition. As an alternative, we explore the use of regularization techniques to
show that the number density of non-interacting bosons in the excited state is finite in two and one
dimensions at low temperatures, making it possible to have aBEC transition in the thermodynamic
limit. We suggest creating two-dimensional optical traps of increasing sizes to test this hypothesis
as the thermodynamic limit is approached.

I.   INTRODUCTION
Einstein showed that Bose’s derivation of Planck’s law involved indistinguishability and
multiple occupancy of a given energy level. This led naturally to the consideration of the
condensation of particles that follow Bose Einstein (BE) statistics.The arguments revolve
around the expression for the number of particles in excited states (N
e
) of a non-interacting
BE system in a given dimensiondis given by[1]:

It turns out that the integral in Eqn.3 is finite in three dimensions, but diverges in one
and two dimensions.  The divergences arise from the low end of the energy spectrum as
we approach the thermodynamic limit. The divergence is interpretedas implying that the
number of bosons in the excited states is infinite and as such can never be less than the
2

number in the ground state. It also implies that the relevant numberdensity in two and one
dimensions is infinite, a somewhat problematic condition.
Gunther et al[2] showed that in the case that the temperature is lowered in an isobaric
process while maintaining an infinite number density, BEC is possible in two dimensions
in the thermodynamic limit.  Later van Druten and Ketterle,[3] as well as Bagnato and
Kleppner[4] showed that in the presence of an external potentialwhich mimics the effects
of an optical trap, BEC is permissible in both one and two dimensions.  The external
potential has to be sufficiently weak for the theorem of Bagnato and Kleppner to work.
These investigations were motivated by the construction of optical traps of finite sizes, and
therefore did not consider the thermodynamic limit. BEC was successfully exhibited in two
dimensions by Gorlitz et al[5] and Rychtarik et al[6] for finite systems.
We show in this paper that the invocation of regularization techniques which render fi-
nite the relevant integrals reveals that BEC is possible in one and two dimensions in the
thermodynamic limit, in the absence of external confining potentials. We suggest creating
two-dimensional optical traps of increasing sizes to test this hypothesis as the thermody-
namic limit is approached. We realize that this is not an easy task.
Our focus in this paper is on ideal bosons which do not interact with each other. Fischer
on the other hand has paid a great deal of attention to interacting, finite systems of bosons[7].
We intend to study interacting bosons in the near future[8].
II.   MARGINALITY OF TWO DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS
The integral in Eqn.3 may be split into two parts:
N
e
(d, τ) =C
d
τ
d
2
(
∫
α
0
dx
x
d
2
−1
exp(x)−1
+
∫
∞
α
dx
x
d
2
−1
exp(x)−1
)
(5)
where it is easy to see that the right hand side of Eqn.5 is independentof the value ofα.
The logic behind the split into two integrals is to demonstrate, as donein field theory, that
an additive divergent part can be identified and isolated. The finite residue is then granted
physical properties.
In two dimensions the areal number densityn
e
is governed by the behavior of the integrand
in Eqn.3 asx→0:
3

n
e
(2, τ)≈C
2
τ
∫
α
0
dx
x
(6)
wheren
e
(2, τ) =N
e
/L
2
is the areal number density in two dimensions, wherec
2
=M/(π~
2
),
Mbeing the mass of the BE particle andLbeing the linear extent of the system in each
dimension. The “infra-red” divergence is caused by attempting to go to the thermodynamic
limit as the linear dimension of the systemL→ ∞, and the discrete sum over states is
converted to an integral. The divergence of the integral is interpreted pedagogically as an
indication that the number of particles in the excited states is unbound at all temperatures
and thus prohibits BEC in two dimensions. We find this interpretation problematic as it
essentially implies an infinite areal number density of bosons (N
e
/L
2
) in two dimensions.
Notice that the divergence is merely logarithmic and one can enquire what happens if an
“infrared” cutoff is employed to render the integral finite:
n
e
(2, τ)→n
e
(2, τ, x
c
)≈−c
2
τln(x
c
)(7)
It is reasonable to assume that the cutoffx
c
∝L
−2
in two dimensions. The logarithmic
dependence onx
c
implies that there is only a weak dependence on the size of the system.
The finiteness ofn
e
now implies the existence of BEC in two dimensions. An expression for
the temperature at which BEC occurs can now written down and it depends only weakly on
the cutoffx
c
. We suggest creating two-dimensional optical traps of increasingsizes to test
this hypothesis as the thermodynamic limit is approached.
An alternate way to cast the discussion regarding the cutoff is to note thatn
e
(2, τ, x
c
)
possesses the following scaling property:
n
e
(2, τ, λx
c
) =n
e
(2, τ, x
c
)−c
2
τln(λ)(8)
Now BEC in two dimensions has been investigated before by Gunther et al[2], who argued
in essence that the divergence ofn
e
in two dimensions could be circumvented by considering
an isobaric process. In this sense they suggested that BEC could occur in two dimensions.
Our strategy is to use Renormalization Group theory arguments torevisitn
e
in two dimen-
sions, and we come to qualitatively similar conclusions regarding BEC in two dimensions
while allowing the two dimensional number density to remain finite.
4

Renormalization group techniques involve two concepts. One is a setof scaling transfor-
mations under which the model remains invariant. The other is regularization techniques
to render finite relevant integrals which diverge. These two concepts are then combined to
provide insights into higher order corrections to the theory. At this point it may be tempt-
ing to invoke scaling arguments along the lines of those employed by Abrahams et al[9] in
the context of electron localization (1978), given the logarithmic dependence we found in
Eqn.7. But the problem of electron localization is quite different in thatthe conductance
of two-dimensional disordered systems can only be calculated approximately and Renor-
malization group theory arguments were invoked to understand higher order effects in the
thermodynamic limit.
Here our focus is on more on regularization methods, as we are considering non-interacting
bosons. In the next section we will use a method analogous to dimensional regularization to
obtain an unambiguous expression for the transition temperature, independent of the cutoff.
It is possible that scaling analyses[9] may be useful when interactingbosons are considered.
III.   DIMENSIONAL REGULARIZATION ARGUMENTS IN TWO DIMENSIONS
The arguments presented above leaves us with a choice to be made forx
c
. One can propose
a cutoff based on physical arguments. The need to make this choicecan be circumvented by
appealing to dimensional regularization. Dimensional regularization infield theory revolves
around the divergence of the inverse of the gamma function. In our case, we find that it
revolves around the Riemann zeta functionζ(s).
The relevant integral we need to study has the following form:
I(s)=
∫
∞
0
dx
x
s−1
exp(x)−1
= Γ(s)ζ(s)(9)
wheres=d/2. From Erdelyi et al, one can find the following series forζ(s) due to Hardy:
ζ(s) =
1
s−1
+γ+

∑
n=1
γ
n
(s−1)
n
(10)
whereγ= 0.5772..., and the coefficientsγ
n
in turn are given by a series expansion.
5

We see that ford= 2, whens= 1, the finite part ofζ(1) is simplyγ. We now identify
the physically relevant part of the integral forn
e
as being proportional toγ.  The BEC
temperature in two dimensionsT

We suggest creating two-dimensional optical traps of increasing sizes to test this hypoth-
esis as the thermodynamic limit is approached.
IV.   ONE DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS
As in the two-dimensional case, the integral expression for the number of excited BE
particles in one dimension is divergent unless an infra-red cutoffx
c
is imposed. By choosing
1>> α >> x
c
, the number density of bosons in the excited stateN
e

as:

wherec

numerically if required.
We propose that the divergent term (∝x
−3/2
c
) be canceled through the invocation of
a counterterm as done in field theory, leaving a finite residue asx
c
→0.  The physical
interpretation is that the number of excited bosons in one dimensionn
e
(1, τ) is finite, im-
plying a BEC condensation in one dimension. Note that the resultant BEC temperature is
independent on the cutoff asx
c
→0.
We have been unable to construct a dimensional regularization argument in one dimension
similar to the two-dimensional argument in the previous section.

V.   GENERAL DISCUSSION
In the case of electron localization in disordered systems it was shown[9] that while
there is a smooth transition from extended to localized states in three dimensions, all states
are localized in a disordered system in one and two dimensions.  This conclusion turns
out to be consistent with the Mermin-Wagner theorem which was specifically proven for
the case of magnetism. Onsager’s solution of the Ising model in two dimensions and the
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition are notable exceptions to this theorem. We have argued here
that a transition to a BEC state is possible in three and two and one dimensions in the
thermodynamic limit.
While our arguments apply strictly speaking to non-interacting systems, we hypothesize
that interacting boson systems can be adequately described via aneffective mass, so that
our arguments will carry over simply. However, the problem of interactions has to be treated
rigorously in the thermodynamic limit, as done by Fischer[7] for finitesystems.
VI.   CONCLUSIONS
We have argued here that a transition to a BEC state is possible in twoand one di-
mensions in the thermodynamic limit. Regularization techniques were invoked to draw our
conclusions. We suggest creating two-dimensional optical traps of increasing sizes to test
this hypothesis as the thermodynamic limit is approached.

Abstract
We investigate collective oscillations in a trapped Bose–Fermimixture gas in the normal phase, com-
posed of single species bosons and single species fermions. In the extremely low temperature regime, col-
lisions between bosons and fermions are limited by the Pauli-blocking, while collisions between bosons
may be enhanced by Bose-enhancement. These quantum statistical properties may give rise to an in-
teresting temperature dependence of collective modes. Applying the moment method to the linearized
Boltzmann equation, we study the crossover of the dipole mode of the trapped Bose–Fermi mixture gas
between hydrodynamic and collisionless regimes.

I.  INTRODUCTION
Ultracold atomic gases have opened up opportunities for studying newquantum systems,
which have been not addressed before. In contrast to the liquid helium
3
He and/or
4
He, the
quantum gases provides many kinds of mixtures, with changing quantum statistics, mass ra-
tio, ratio of number of particles, strength of interaction, and geometry of confinement [1]. In
particular, a Bose–Fermi mixture is one of the most interesting mixture, because this system
has different quantum statistics. Using Bose–Fermi mixtures, some collective modes, such as
quadrupole oscillations [
2], and breathing mode of a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) with a
fermionic reservoir [
3] have been experimentally investigated. Theoretical studies on collec-
tive modes of a Bose–Fermi mixture is also investigated, for example, monopole and multipole
modes using variational-sum-rule approach [
4], and using a scaling ansatz formalism [5], low-
lying modes in spinor Bose–Fermi mixtures [
6], density and single-particle excitation using a
random-phase approximation [
7], monopole and multipole modes for trapped phase-segregated
mixtures [8], and a dipole mode using the variational-sum-rule approach [9].
In a Bose–Fermi mixture, phase space of collisions between bosonsand fermions are limited
by the Pauli-blocking, while collisions between bosons may be enhancedby Bose-enhancement.
These competitive quantum statistical properties may give rise to aninteresting property of col-
lective modes. In fact, in the case of a spatial uniform system, there exists a long-lived sound mode
in the crossover region between collisionless and hydrodynamic regimes [
10]. In this paper, con-
sidering the familiar experimental situation in ultracold atomic gases, we study dipole modes in
a Bose–Fermi mixture for exploring exotic collective mode. We focus on a trapped Bose–Fermi
mixture in the normal phase, composed of single species bosons and single species fermions.
We employ a moment method in this paper. This method is useful for analyzing dynamics of a
dilute gas, the feature of which is able to describe a crossover between the hydrodynamic and
collisionless regimes [
11–15].

. We realize interesting features of the dipole
mode from Eqs. (
12) and (13). In the collisionless regime, there are four oscillating modes. Onthe
other hand, in the hydrodynamic regime, there are two oscillating modes. During the crossover
from the collisionless to hydrodynamic regimes, two oscillating modes disappears. In the hydro-
dynamic regime, there are two purely-damped relaxation modes. One is the fast relaxing mode:
the damping rate of which is proportional toτ. This mode describes the relaxation out-of-phase
motion due to collisions between two components. An interest mode is the other relaxation
mode: the damping rate of which is proportional to 1/τ, which is very slow decay mode and
distinct from the fast purely-damped out-of-phase mode.
We also show the features including the intermediate region between hydrodynamic and col-
lisionless limit. Figure

lisionless regime in high temperature region is due to the low particledensity in trapped gases,

leading to the small relaxation rate. On the other hand, in the low temperature regime, the relax-
ation rate becomes small again, because of the suppression of collisions due to Fermi degeneracy.

III.  CONCLUSIONS
We investigated collective oscillations in a trapped Bose–Fermi mixture gas in the normal
phase, composed of single species bosons and single species fermions. Applying the moment
method to the linearized Boltzmann equation, we derived the eigenfrequency and damping rate
in the hydrodynamic and collisionless regimes. In the crossover fromthe collisionless to hydro-
dynamic regimes, two oscillating modes disappears. Furthremore, inthe hydrodynamic regime,
there are two purely-damped modes. One is the fast purely-damped mode, which describes the
relaxation of the out-of-phase motion of two components. An interest mode is the other purely-
damped mode, the damping rate of which is small. By sweeping relaxation time, we illustrated the
crossover between the collisionless and hydrodynamic regimes. However, considering tempera-
ture dependence of the relaxation time, the crossover does not achieve for the set of parameters
chosen in the present paper. We found the tendency to become collisionless regime not only in
high temperature region but also in extreme low temperature because of Fermi degeneracy. In the
future paper, we will attack the crossover of the eigenmodes and physics of the slow relaxation
mode.

Non-Abelian Berry Gauge Field and Topological Invariant in Parity-Time Symmetric
Non-Hermitian Spin-1/2 Quantum Systems

(Dated: July 18, 2019)
Recently developed parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetric non-Hermitian quantum theory is envisioned
to have far-reaching implications and applications. It is known that thePT-inner product is defined with respect
to a non-canonical, system generated symmetry, namely theCsymmetry.  We show that thePTsymmetric
equation of motion is defined by the simultaneous time evolution of the stateψ(t)and the operatorC(t)to
manifests unitarity−a situation analogous to the Dirac/interaction picture.   The time-dependentCoperator
lends  itself  into  a  new  term  in  the  Berry  phase,  setting  a  platform  for  novel  and  exotic  topological  phases.
We also point out that the gauge invariance is achieved by a more genericCPTgauge transformation,  not
by the usual unitary gauge transformation.  ThePTsymmetric theory is not generally applicable for spin-1/2
fermions, since herePTinner product becomes undefined due to Kramer’s theory. We propose a realizable non-
Hermitian setup for spin-1/2 fermions which acquires the combined(PT)
2
= +1symmetry, despiteT
2
=−1
andP
2
= +1.  The Hamiltonian inherits non-Abelian Berry gauge fields for non-interacting fermions without
magnetic field. The corresponding edge states are found to have unique supersymmetric oscillator solutions but
with complex energy levels.
Non-Abelian Berry gauge field and corresponding topolog-
ical  phases  can  arise  in  degenerate  ground  states  with  non-
trivial band structure.[1–5] Such systems are highly desirable
for obtaining anyons, fractons, supersymmetry with their im-
plications for quantum computing and other applications.[6–
11] The fractional quantum Hall states with applied magnetic
field  (mainlyν=  5/2state)[12–15]  or  certain  interacting
topological antiferromagnetic insulators[4, 5, 16],  and topo-
logical superconductors[17, 18] provide viable routes to ob-
tain non-Abelian excitations in condensed matter setup. How-
ever, proposals and realizations of intrinsic generation of non-
Abelian states in non-interacting systems and without applied
magnetic field are long-sought in condensed matter and mate-
rials science community.
Topological  phases  in  non-Hermitian  (NH)  Hamiltonians
without  and  with  real  energy  have  been  widely  explored  in
recent  years.[19]  Owing  to  complex  energy  spectrum  and
biorthogonal probability density,  one may expect a plethora
of distinct topological invariants in NH systems which may
or  may  not  have  any  direct  analogue  with  their  Hermitian
counterparts.[20, 21] Such studies can become more interest-
ing in NH systems which posses real eigenenergies and con-
served probability density with the help of pseudo-Hermitian
metric,[22]  and/or  parity  (P)  -  time  reversal  (T)  symmetry
invariance.[23] So far Abelian topological phases are mainly
studied in various NH systems.[20, 21, 24] Band degeneracy,
a  prerequisite  for  non-Abelian  phases,  is  quite  exceptional
in NH systems, since here the corresponding wavefunctions
coalesce.[25]  Such  exceptional  points  apparently  hinder  the
possibility to stabilizing non-Abelian phases in this class of
materials.
Our  work  presents  several  novel  features.   (i)  WhilePT
symmetry solely can guarantee real eigenvalues, thePT-inner
product  is  not  always  positive,  definite.[23]  Moreover,  the
time-evolution  of  the  state  is  not  always  ‘unitary’.   This  is
remedied by defining a hidden, non-canonical symmetry, of-
ten termed asCsymmetry, such that theCPT-inner product
is  positive  definite.[23]  Intriguingly,  we  show  that  the  con-
servation of the probability density is defined by thesimul-
taneoustime-evolution  of  stateψ(t)and  theC(t)operator.
This  situation  is  reminiscence  of  the  Dirac/interaction  pic-
ture, except here physical operators are not necessarily time-
dependent.  (ii) We also find that adiabatic time evolution of
bothψ(t),C(t)conspires  a  new  and  important  term  to  the
Berry phase and topological invariants.  (iii) Interestingly, the
U(N)gauge invariance and co-variance of the Berry phase
and Berry connection, respectively, are defined with respect
to aCPTinvariant gauge transformation, replacing the usual
unitary  transformation  for  the  Hermitian  counterparts.   (iv)
The abovePT-invariant quantum theory is generally defined
for(PT)
2
= 1, in which case the Hamiltonian andPTop-
erator  share  the  same  eigenfunctions.   For  spinful  systems,
this is generally a problem since hereT
2
=−1, making the
PT-inner product to vanish for all eigenstates (Kramer’s de-
generacy).  To bypass this problem, we propose a setup with
coupled quantum wires with opposite NH spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) in adjacent layers.   The setup is designed to possess
‘parity’Pvia spin and sublattice inversions, such thatPand
Tanticommutes with each other, giving(PT)
2
=  +1, de-
spiteP
2
=  +1, andT
2
=−1.  The system possesses real
eigenvalues,  and conservedCPTinner product under a dy-
namicalCoperator. (v) Under theCPTinvariance, the system
possess degeneracy which intrinsically governs non-Abelian
Berry connection, and winding number in a periodic boundary
condition. (vi) Finally, we show that the edge state of the non-
trivial topological phase has unique solutions. Two edge states
are  found  to  possess  coupled  harmonic  oscillator  like  solu-
tions, with complex but quantized eigenvalues and localized
Gaussian wavepackets.  More intriguingly, the two solutions
are related to each other by mutually skipping eigenstates−
a situation which is qualitatively analogous to the ‘supersym-
metric’ oscillator solutions,[26] but generalized here for com-

following discussions hold for this generic requirement, how-
ever, as often done, we specialize henceforth to the symmetric

The Hamiltonian follows the eigenvalue equation:H|ψ

are  real  due  toPTinvari-
ance.   An essential generic issue of thePT-invariant quan-
tum  theory  is  that  thePT-inner  product  is  not  a  constant
of  motion,  and  hence  there  exists  adynamical,  and  non-
canonical symmetryCwhich evolves in time in such a way
that theCPT- inner product becomes conserved.  TheCop-
erator follows[H,C] = 0, and[PT,C] = 0, with theCPT-
inner  product  defined  as〈ψ

For  a  Hermitian  case,  the  time  evolution  of  the  state  is
solely governed by the Hamiltonian itself.   This is not gen-
erally true for NH systems.  LetQbe a linear time evolution

The Hamiltonian.Inspired by the fact thatPT-symmetric
systems can be readily engineered in optical lattices,[21] and
that SOC is also realized in 1D optical lattices,[29] we con-
struct a setup made of coupled 1D optical wires with NH SOC.

Symmetry properties.Its now worthwhile delineating the

symmetric Hamiltonian,(PT)

ment to ensure real eigenvalues. But for half-integer spin, we
haveT

allnstates, and hence thePTconjugate Hilbert space col-
lapses.  We succeed overcoming this challenge by the special
design of the setup, in which the two adjacent wires not only
act as right and left eigenstates, but also serve asPTconju-
gate to each other.

FIG. 2.  (a-c) Band structure plots for three different representative
cases.  (a) Forb

Forb

k↓
,  both bands are split at allk-points except at two
characteristick-point where the band inversion occurs.  In both (a)
and (b) cases, the bands are real and obtain the same non-Abelian
Berry phase.  (c) For the case of|b
k+
|<|α

is broken and bands become complex.  (d-f) We plotα

k+
for
k=−πtoπ.   This exhibit howθ

evolves in an adiabatic cycle
for the corresponding upper panel.  The gray region depicts thePT
broken region, while the white region gives thePT-unbroken region.
In our Hamiltonian, both coefficientsiα
k
andb

breakT
symmetry; withiα
k
isPTinvariant, whileb
kσ
is not (since
b
kσ
is even under spatial inversion).  This implies that theP
operator cannot be a simple chiral inversion (i.e., R↔L), but
must also involve spin inversion and at the same time be uni-
tary. Hence the total ‘parity’ operator is a combination of mo-
mentum and spin inversions:P=τ
x
⊗σ
x
, withP

(τ

and spin flips:T=iτ

states of Eq. (8) gives〈ψ

In addition, the Hamiltonian in Eq. (6) has both the charge

Non-Abelian Berry phase.There exist some intriguing re-
lationships between the odd and even eigenstates of Eq. (8).
(i) We have∂

are related to each other by a rotation
ofπ/2and a phase ofπ/2.  These redundancies suggest that
there exists an inherent ground state degeneracy in this sys-
tem. These two conditions guarantee the existence of a robust
non-Abelian Berry phase betweenψ

under adiabatic evolution of the state. Furthermore, with a pe-
riodic boundary condition,  the corresponding winding num-
bers are quantized.
The   Berry   connection   from   Eq.   (3)   have   two   terms.
The  adiabatic  evolution  of  the  eigenstate  yields  the  first
term:A

Here, we point out an interesting feature of the angleθ

.ThePT-symmetric  region  is  defined  by

In  Fig.  2,  we  examine  the  topological  phase  diagram  in
three  representative  regions.   In  thePT-symmetric  region,
|α

|condition opens a band gap across the Fermi
level.   Forb

=b

,  there is a two-fold degeneracy at all
k-points.b

lifts the degeneracy except at charac-
teristickpoints where bands are inverted.  The existence of
these characteristic band inversionk-points within the Bril-
louin zone is responsible for finite non-Abelian Berry phase in
the setup. Finally, in thePT-broken region for|α
k
|>|b
k+
|,
see Figs. 2(c,f), we find that the non-Abelian Berry phase per-
sists but becomes a complex number.
Boundary states.The  bulk-boundary  correspondence  for
thePT-symmetric NH topological insulator is not as concrete
as in the Hermitian case.[19, 24] This is because even when
thePT-symmetry is intact in the bulk, this symmetry may be
lost at the boundary for the same parameter region.   In our
model,  thePTsymmetry is broken at the boundary giving
complex energy.  However, interestingly, the boundary states
are localized at the edge like a harmonic oscillator.
For the discussion of the boundary state, a suitable choice
of basis is:

The rotated Hamiltonian in this basis acquires a simpler block

Conclusions.Our work presented a number of important
aspects of theCPTinvariant quantum theory, including the
dynamical  nature  of  theCoperator,  and  its  unique  conse-
quences,CPTinvariance gauge transformation, extension of
thePTinvariant quantum theory to spinfull fermions, non-
Abelian topological features,  and an analogue of supersym-
metric edge state solutions.  We highlighted previously unex-
plored the dynamical nature of theCoperator, and its crucial
role on the conservation of probability in time-dependent sys-
tems, and the theory ofCPTinvariant gauge invariance and
co-variance.  The dynamical evolution of theCoperator not
only ensures probability conservations, but also contributes a
new term to the Berry phase.  We proposed a method of by-
passing  the  hurdle  ofT
2
=−1symmetry  associated  with

5
spin-1/2 fermions to obtain the(PT)
2
=  +1symmetry for
NH  Hamiltonians  with  real  eigenvalues.   We  also  find  that
the proposed spinfull Hamiltonian possess non-Abelian Berry
gauge field and unique supersymmetric-like localized bound-
ary states despite complex eigenvalues. Our work contributes
to the development of completeCPT-invariant theory for dy-
namical systems, the evolution of geometric phase for spinfull
systems, and sets up a pathway to achieve non-Abelian exci-
tations without applied magnetic field or interactions.

Time evolution ofPT-invariant systems
Let us consider a linear time evolution of the eigenstates for
aPT- symmetric system is
i~|
 ̇
ψ(t)〉=Q(t)|ψ(t)〉,(18)
whereQ(t)is a generic time-evolution operator. Dot denotes
time-derivative.  For the Hermitian case,Q(t)  =H.Qbe-
comes  different  for  aCPT-invariant  system.   The  physical
constraint to keep in mind is that theCPT-inner product of
the system is a constant of motion, i.e.,∂

Using Eqs. (18) and (19), we obtain the equation of motion of
theC-operator as

CPT= [Q,CPT].(20)
(Eq. (20) can be equivalently written asi~
 ̇
C=

whereQ

is understood to bePTcon-
jugate.)
At this point, we can infer two properties of theQopera-
tor. Firstly, Eq. (20) implies that unlike the Hamiltonian itself,
Qisnot,  in  general,CPT-invariant;  otherwiseCbecomes
a constant of motion.  Secondly,  in the above derivation we
have used the symmetry property thatQ
T
=Q(whereTis
the transpose), which is in accord with the symmetric Hamil-
tonian assumed here.  (Otherwise, the derivation can also be
proceeded with keeping the transpose operator throughout the
derivation below.)
SinceQis  a  generic  symmetric  matrix,  it  can  be  ex-
pressed as a sum of aCPT-symmetric matrix (say,S), and
aCPT-antisymmetric matrix (say,A):Q=S+A, where
[S,CPT] = 0, &{A,CPT}= 0. Since eitherSorAcan be
chosen arbitrarily, without loosing generality, we setS≡H
for anyCPT-symmetric Hamiltonian.  ThenAcan be deter-
mined easily.  Notice that forAto be be antisymmetric with
CPT, it should follow either (i)[A,PT] = 0and{A,C}= 0,
or (ii){A,PT}=  0and[A,C]  =  0.  In both cases, we get
from Eq. (20) thatA=
i~
2
C

 ̇
C. Therefore, the final result of
the time-evolution operator is
Q=H+
i~
2
C

 ̇
C.(21)
This is an important result which implies that that the time-
evolution of the system is governed by both the Hamiltonian
and theC-operator to make sure the probability of the state
remains a constant of motion.
Non-Abelian Berry matrix
Let us assume the system adiabatically evolves in time such
that  the  time-dependent  Hamiltonian  possess  instantaneous
eigenstates|ψ

H(t)|ψ

|ψ

For generality, we assume each eigenstate isN-fold degener-
ate.  (Since Berry phase does not dependent on onsite energy,
without loosing generality, we setE
n
= 0for simplicity.  It
can be shown that the result remains unchanged forE
n
6= 0as
long as its real.) In the adiabatic limit, the total wavefunction

Edge state calculations
The bulk-boundary correspondence for thePT-symmetric
NH topological insulators is not as concrete as in the Hermi-
tian case, and relies on systems under consideration as well as
the symmetry invariance. This is quite evident because of the
fact that the real eigenvalues, and conserved eigenstates in the
bulk are protected by thePT-symmetry (or rather theCPT
symmetry), whereas such a symmetry may be inevitably lost
at the boundary even if the system resides in the same parame-
ter regime. Such a case also occurs in the present Hamiltonian.
For the discussion of the boundary state, a suitable choice of
basis is obtained to be as follows.

ergy spectrum and localized Gaussian-like states.  To demon-

Relaxation to gaussian and generalized Gibbs states in systems of particles with

(Dated:  July 16, 2019)
We present an elementary,  general,  and semi-quantitative description of relaxation to gaussian
and generalized Gibbs states in lattice models of fermions or bosons with quadratic hamiltonians.
Our  arguments  apply  to  arbitrary  initial  states  that  satisfy  a  mild  condition  on  clustering  of
correlations.   We  also  show  that  similar  arguments  can  be  used  to  understand  relaxation  (or  its
absence) in systems with time-dependent quadratic hamiltonians, and provide a semi-quantitative
description of relaxation in quadratic periodically driven (Floquet) systems.
I.    INTRODUCTION
In recent years, there has been much work on under-
standing the nature of the equilibrium state, and the dy-
namics of the relaxation to this state, in quantum many-
body systems with an extensive number of local conser-
vation  laws.   The  motivation  for  the  study  of  these  in-
tegrable  models  is  twofold.   First,  beautiful  cold-atom
experiments have successfully realized many such models
and studied their nonequilibrium dynamics (for reviews,
see [1–4]).  Second, integrable models are much easier to
analyze theoretically than their non-integrable brethren
(for reviews, see [5, 6]).
When prepared in a generic initial state, an integrable
system does not thermalize in the usual sense of the word,
due to the extensive number of local conserved quanti-
ties.  Instead, the stationary behavior at late times can
be described by an appropriategeneralized Gibbs ensem-
ble(GGE). For our purposes, the “GGE conjecture” put
forth  in  Ref.  [7]  and  subsequently  refined  by  many  au-
thors ([3] and references therein),  asserts the following:
assuming that local observables in an integrable many-
body system relax to stationary values, these values may
be computed using the density matrix

imizing  the  entropyS=−Tr( ˆρlog ˆρ)  subject  to  these
constraints.
In  this  paper  we  consider  the  simplest  class  of  in-
tegrable  models:  those  whose  hamiltonians  can  be  ex-

pressed as quadratic forms in a set of canonical particle
creation and annihilation operators.  Such so-callednon-
interacting integrablemodels describe not only truly non-
interacting particles, but also mean-field approximations
to models of interacting particles.  In view of this, we will
refer to the models of interest as “quadratic” rather than
“non-interacting integrable”.  In one dimension,  certain
other integrable models—some spin chains and systems
of hard-core particles—can be mapped to quadratic ones.
However, simple observables in the original model often
map  to  complicated  operators  in  the  quadratic  model,
and one must take this into account when using the map-
ping to study relaxation [9].
In quadratic models, the local conserved charges
ˆ
I
m
are
also typically quadratic (we demonstrate this explicitly
in Section V A), and therefore the GGE density operator
ˆρ
GGE
isgaussian.  It is thus quite natural to divide relax-
ation in quadratic models into two process: (i) relaxation
of the initial state to a gaussian one, and (ii) relaxation
of  the  gaussian  state  to  the  appropriate  GGE.  Our  ar-
guments will make clear that these two processes occur
for fundamentally distinct physical reasons, and also that
the first process often (but not always) occurs faster than
the  second.   We  will  also  show  that  similar  arguments
can  be  used  to  understand  relaxation  in  systems  with
quadratic  time-periodic  hamiltonians.   Considering  the
great recent interest in driven quantum systems ([10, 11]
and references therein),  we believe that this is a useful
synthesis of ideas.
Recently,  Gluza et al. [12] have argued that the first
process  mentioned  above  (which  they  term  “gaussifica-
tion”) can be understood as a consequence of exponen-
tial clustering of correlations in the initial state, together
with “delocalizing transport” (the sufficiently rapid sup-
pression of the component of an operator on any given
site,  due to its “spreading out” over a large area),  and
have rigorously proven this implication for fermionic lat-
tice systems with quadratic time-independent hamiltoni-
ans.  The importance of clustering of correlations in the
initial state for relaxation had earlier been emphasized by
Cramer and Eisert [13], and by Sotiriadis and Calabrese
[14], who had shown that it is in fact a necessary and suf-
ficient condition for relaxation to GGE in a broad class

of  translation-invariant  quadratic  models.   Other  early
studies of the validity of the GGE in quadratic systems
(e.g.  [15,  16])  typically  assumed  gaussian  initial  states,
and  hence  addressed  only  the  second  process  described
in  the  previous  paragraph.   Our  results  are  consistent
with, and generalize, the results of these earlier works.
Note that, in the decade since Ref. [7] appeared, the va-
lidity of the GGE has been the subject of a large number
of theoretical and numerical investigations, of which the
works cited above comprise only a handful.  It is beyond
the  scope  of  this  paper  to  give  a  reasonably  complete
summary  and/or  critical  discussion  of  all  these  efforts;
for this, we refer the reader to one of the recent reviews
of the field, e.g. [3, 5, 6].
Here, we distill the basic ideas present in [14] and espe-
cially in [12], and give an elementary, general, and semi-
quantitative description of relaxation in quadratic lattice
models.  To state our results, we need to introduce some
notation.   Let
ˆ
ψ
a
x
denote  the  particle  creation  (a=  +)
or  annihilation  (a=−)  operator  for  the  site  at  posi-
tionx.  Under Heisenberg time-evolution with any time-
dependent quadratic hamiltonian
ˆ
H(t),  these operators
evolve linearly:
ˆ
ψ
a
x
(t) =
∑
b=±
∑
y
G
ab

(t)
ˆ
ψ

y
.(2)
This   equation   defines   thesingle-particle   propagator
G
ab
xy
(t), which plays a central role in the following.
For  most  of  this  work,  we  assumedelocalizing  dy-
namics:
∣
∣
G
ab
xy
(t)
∣
∣
→0ast→∞.(3)
The terminology is adapted from Ref. [12].  Equation (3)
may be interpreted as saying that a particle (or hole) cre-
ated atxhas vanishing probability amplitude to be found
at any givenyafter infinite time, because its wavefunc-
tion  “spreads  out”  indefinitely.   In  the  case  of  bosons,
we also require the quasiparticle spectrum of
ˆ
H(t) to be
uniformly bounded and positive-definite.  Note that we
do  notrestrict the hamiltonian to be time-independent
in general.
We treatarbitrary initial statesthat satisfy a mild con-
dition on(algebraic) clustering of correlations:

for some >0.  Here,〈〈···〉〉denotes theconnected  cor-
relation functionin the initial state, anddis the spatial
dimension.   We  emphasize  that  the  initial  state  is  not
assumed to have any relation whatsoever to the hamil-
tonian under which the system subsequently evolves.  In
particular, the initial state may be strongly interacting.
We also emphasize that the cluster decomposition prop-
erty (4) is anextremely weak constrainton the state; one
can expect it to hold for most initial states of interest.  In
fact, a stronger version of (4) has beenrigorously proven
for large classes of states, including ground states of inter-
acting local hamiltonians with a spectral gap [17, 18], as
well as thermal states of arbitrary short-ranged fermionic
lattice models at sufficiently high temperature [19].
Our  emphasis  throughout  this  paper  is  on  simplicity
and physical transparency rather than on mathematical
rigor; the reader in search of the latter is encouraged to
consult Ref. [12] and similar works in parallel with our
treatment.  Nevertheless, we believe that most of the ar-
guments presented here can serve as sketches for rigorous
proofs.
Our main technical results are summarized below.
1. “Gaussification” under general conditions:In
any lattice system of fermions or bosons prepared in an
initial state satisfying (4) and evolving under a quadratic
hamiltonian
ˆ
H(t) that leads to delocalizing dynamics (3),
all  local  (n >2)-point  connected  correlation  functions
vanish at late times:

ˆ
ψ

)〉〉→0ast
j
→∞.(5)
Following Ref. [12], we refer to this vanishing as “gaussi-
fication”, because it is equivalent to the dynamical recov-
ery of Wick’s theorem—the distinguishing property of a
gaussian state.  This result significantly generalizes that
of  Ref.  [12],  where  gaussification  was  proven  for  time-
independent fermion lattice models and initial states with
exponential clustering of correlations.
2.  Universal  power-law  gaussification:In  many
cases  of  interest  one  can  identify,  for  eachx,a,  andt,
a  definite  volumeV
a
x
(t)  ofy-space  in  which  the  single-
particle  propagatorG
ab
xy
(t)  is  meaningfully  supported.
In these cases we obtain a more quantitative version of
Eq. (5):
〈〈
ˆ

Typically,V(t)  grows  like  a  power  oft.   Thus,  Eq.  (6)
gives power-law decay of the connected correlation func-
tions in time, with exponents that depend only onnand
on how fast the single-particle propagator of the system
spreads.
3. Gaussianity of GGE:We prove that all local con-
served quantities of a time-independent quadratic hamil-
tonian with delocalizing dynamics (3) are also quadratic,
and  therefore  that  the  associated  GGE  density  matrix
is indeed gaussian.  In past work this property appears
simply to have been taken for granted.
4.  Relaxation  to  GGE:For  any  time-independent
hamiltonian that satisfies (3), and any initial state that
satisfies (4) and an additional assumption to be described
below, we show that the system relaxes to the GGE; for
any local operator
ˆ
O,
〈
ˆ
O(t)〉→〈

ast→∞.(7)

This  result  is  consistent  with  and  generalizes  existing
proofs of relaxation to the GGE to a larger class of mod-
els and initial states.  The additional assumption is for-
mulated  precisely  in  Section  V C  (Eq.  (135)).   Roughly
speaking, it excludes situations in which the initial pro-
files  of  local  conserved  densities  are  inhomogeneous  on
length  scales  comparable  to  the  system  size.   In  such
cases,  the  GGE  conjecture  fails  for  a  trivial  reason:  it
takes infinitely long for the locally conserved density to
flow across the whole system in the thermodynamic limit.
5. Universal power-law relaxation:Under the con-
ditions of the previous result, we also obtain quantitative
estimates for how the local 2-point function relaxes to its
GGE value.  Consider the instantaneous deviation

Assume, as is often the case, that the density of quasi-
particle  states  of

Hnear  the  band  edge  has  the  form

δC

whereα= 1 if there is a density wave of one or more of
the conserved quantities in the initial state,  andα= 2
if not.  In particular, fortranslation-invariantquadratic
hamiltonians inddimensions,
δC

whereαis  defined  above.   Note  that  this  result  holds
forgenerichamiltonians  and  initial  states  of  the  types
considered;  different exponents can and do occur if the
hamiltonian and/or initial state is fine-tuned.
6.  Floquet-GGE:For  anytime-periodicquadratic
hamiltonian
ˆ
H(t) =
ˆ
H(t+T) that satisfies (3), we prove
that all local conserved quantities of the associated Flo-
quet hamiltonian
ˆ
H
F
are quadratic, and hence that the
Floquet-GGE [20] density matrix,  ˆρ
F
,  is gaussian.  For
any initial state that satisfies the assumptions of result
4 above, we show that the system eventually relaxes to
this (time-periodic) Floquet-GGE. In the limitT→0 of
fast driving, we expect to observe power-law relaxation
to ˆρ
F
, with the exponents given by results 2 and 5 above
applied to
ˆ
H
F
.  In the opposite limitT→∞of slow driv-
ing, we expect to observe power-law relaxation toward a
GGE of the instantaneous hamiltonian
ˆ
H(t), followed by
much slower exponential relaxation∼e
−t/T
toward  ˆρ
F
.
Our results are consistent with, and generalize, the orig-
inal  treatment  of  this  problem  by  Lazarides  et  al.  [21]
(in which the initial state was assumed to be gaussian,
and no estimates like the ones above were given for the
relaxation process itself).
7. Effects/non-effects of localized states:We find
that dynamics generated by a quadratic fermion hamilto-
nian
ˆ
Hwhose quasiparticle spectrum includes discrete lo-
calized levels (so that Eq. (3) is violated)will still lead to
gaussification  and  equilibration  to  an  appropriate  GGE,
as  long  as  (i)  the  initial  state  has  a  finite  correlation
lengthξ, and (ii) the spatial distance between any pair of
localized levels is large relative toξ.  This result should
be viewed as an interesting (but easily understandable;
see Section VI) exception to the general rule [22, 23] that
the GGE fails if the spectrum of
ˆ
Hcontains a pure-point
part coming from localized levels.  If either of the condi-
tions (i) or (ii) above is violated, we recover the expected
failure of gaussification and of the GGE. Thus, our results
are fully consistent with those of Ziraldo et al. [22, 23],
who considered the case that
ˆ
His disordered; in this case
condition (ii) will typically be violated.
Organization of the paper
In  Section  II  we  introduce  our  arguments  in  a  sim-
ple  and  concrete  setting:   a  1d  tight-binding  model  of
spinless  fermions.   In  Section  III  we  define  the  general
problem and fix terminology and notation.  In Section IV
we  present  our  argument  for  gaussification  in  arbitrary
quadratic  models  (of  particles),  and  predict  the  expo-
nents of the power law decay in time of all higher-point
connected functions.  In Section V we describe the man-
ner  in  which,  for  time-independent  hamiltonians,  the
gaussian  state  equilibrates  to  the  GGE.  In  Section  VI
we describe how discrete localized levels in the spectrum
of the hamiltonian affect relaxation.  In Section VII we
consider  quenches  to  time-periodic  quadratic  hamilto-
nians,  and  describe  relaxation  to  the  Floquet-GGE.  In
Section  VIII  we  briefly  comment  on  the  application  of
our arguments to spin models that can be mapped onto
quadratic fermion models.  Finally, in Section IX we sum-
marize our results.
II.    EXAMPLE: RELAXATION IN A
NEAREST-NEIGHBOR TIGHT-BINDING CHAIN
In this section we introduce our arguments by work-
ing them out carefully in a simple and concrete example,
while emphasizing the key ideas.  This will also serve to
motivate the subsequent general development.
A.    Setup
Consider a tight-binding model of spinless fermions in
d= 1 dimensions,  with nearest-neighbor hopping.  The
hamiltonian is
ˆ
H
0
=−

∑
x=1
(

)
,(11)
where  ˆc
†
x
and  ˆc
x
respectively  create  and  annihilate  a
fermion on the site at positionx.  These operators obey

the standard anti-commutation relations

x
=δ
xy
,(12a)
ˆc
x
ˆc
y
+ ˆc
y
ˆc
x
= 0.(12b)
We have set the lattice spacing equal to 1 and hopping
energy  equal  to  1/2.   We  will  also  set   ̄h=  1.   Periodic
boundary conditions are assumed (siteL+ 1 is identified
with site 1).
Imagine a quench in which the system is prepared in
some  non-equilibrium  initial  state,  represented  by  the
density  operator  ˆρ
0
,  at  timet=  0,  and  subsequently
evolved with the hamiltonian
ˆ
H
0
of Eq. (11).  For the ma-
jority of this example (up to and including Section II E),
we make only two assumptions about  ˆρ
0
.
The first assumption is very important:  ˆρ
0
must obey
the  principle  ofcluster  decomposition[24].Roughly
speaking, this principle requires correlations between lo-
cal operators in the state ˆρ
0
to factorize as the operators
are taken far apart from one another.  We will make this
precise in Eq. (43) (we use a stronger version of the prin-
ciple in this section than we do in our general treatment).
The second assumption isnotimportant, and we im-
pose it only to simplify the example.  We assume that the
initial state conserves total particle number:
[
ˆ
N,ˆρ
0
]
= 0,(13)
where
ˆ
N=
∑
x
ˆc
†
x
ˆc
x
.(14)
In the general treatment of Section III onwards, we make
no assumption like Eq. (13).
In the last part of this example, Section II F, we will
add a third assumption about  ˆρ
0
, Eq. (66).  Nothing in
Sections  II B  through  II E  relies  on  this  extra  assump-
tion;  it  is  only  needed  for  the  analysis  of  Section  II F.
Therefore, we do not state it here.
We will study whether and how local observables of the
system relax to their values in an appropriate generalized
Gibbs ensemble as time progresses.  We first discuss the
construction of this GGE density operator.
B.    Conserved quantities and GGE density operator
The hamiltonian (11) can be diagonalized by introduc-
ing quasi-momentum mode operators:
ˆc
x
=
1
√
L
∑
k
e
ikx
ˆc(k),(15)
wherekruns over all integer multiples of (2π/L) within
the Brillouin zone (−π,π].  In terms of these mode oper-
ators,
ˆ
H
0
=
∑
k
ω(k) ˆc
†
(k)ˆc(k),  ω(k) =−cosk.(16)
The various mode occupation number operators
ˆn(k) = ˆc
†
(k)ˆc(k)(17)
clearly  commute  with
ˆ
H
0
and  with  each  other.    Fur-
thermore, by forming appropriate linear combinations of
them, we can define an extensive set of local conserved
quantities in involution:
ˆ
I
2m
=
∑
k
cos(mk)ˆn(k)(18a)
=
1
2
L
∑
x=1
(
ˆc

)
,(18b)
and
ˆ
I
2m+1
=
∑
k
sin(mk)ˆn(k)(19a)
=
(−i)
2
L
∑
x=1
(
ˆc
†
x
ˆc
x+m
−ˆc
†
x+m
ˆc
x
)
.(19b)
wherem= 0,1,2,....  These clearly commute with
ˆ
H
0
and with one another:
[
ˆ
H
0
,
ˆ
I
m
]
= 0,(20a)
[
ˆ
I
m
,
ˆ
I
m
′
]
= 0(20b)
(in  fact,
ˆ
H
0
=
ˆ
I
2
,  so  the  second  equation  implies  the
first).  They are local because their densities,
∝
(
ˆc
†
x
ˆc
x+m
±ˆc
†
x+m
ˆc
x
)
,(21)
act nontrivially only on finite intervals of lengthm.
The set of local conserved quantities{
ˆ
I
m
}defined in
Eqs. (18) and (19) has the further property of beingmax-
imal: any local conserved quantity
ˆ
Ithat commutes with
all of the
ˆ
I
m
can be expressed as a linear combination of
them,
[
ˆ
I
m
,
ˆ
I
]
= 0∀m=⇒
ˆ
I∈span({
ˆ
I
m
}),(22)
where
span({
ˆ

{
∑

}
.(23)
This  claim  is  easy  to  verify  if  we  assume  that
ˆ
Iis  a
quadratic  operator;  the  only  quadratic  operators  that
commute  with  ˆn(k)  for  allkare  indeed  of  the  form
ˆ
I=
∑
k
f(k)ˆn(k) for some functionf.  However, once we
drop this assumption, the validity of the claim is much
less obvious. One can certainly write down manynonlocal
conserved quantities that violate Eq. (22)—products of
mode occupation numbers,  such as  ˆn(k)ˆn(k
′
)—and one
might wonder whether it is possible to build a local quan-
tity out of linear combinations of these, `a la Eqs. (18) or
(19).  We will address this concern later in our general

5
treatment: in Section V A, we prove that, for a wide class
of quadratic hamiltonians (to which
ˆ
H
0
belongs), all lo-
cal conserved quantities
ˆ
Iare themselves quadratic.  The
claim follows.
Thus, one is tempted to assert that the GGE density
operator for the tight-binding chain has the form
ˆρ
GGE
=
1
Z
GGE
exp
(
−
∑
m

)
(24a)

Z
GGE
exp
(
−
∑
k
μ(k)ˆn(k)
)
,(24b)
where the Lagrange multipliers{λ
m
}are fixed by requir-
ing that
Tr
(
ˆ
I
m
ˆρ
GGE
)
= Tr
(
ˆ
I
m
ˆρ
0
)
;(25)
this in turn fixes the functionμ(k), which is in general
unrelated to the functionω(k) appearing in
ˆ
H
0
.
One may also considertruncated GGEsin which only
the “most local” conservation laws are taken into account
(i.e.  only
ˆ
I
m
withm≤2`are  retained  in  the  density
matrix) [25]; this is equivalent to truncating the Fourier
series ofμ(k) at order`.  More generally, in the limit of
infinite  system  size,L→ ∞,  one  can  require  thatλ
m
decay in a certain manner asm→ ∞; this is equivalent
to  placing  a  smoothness  condition  onμ(k).   Thus,  the
GGE (truncated or not) can be defined either in terms of
the local charges
ˆ
I
m
or in terms of the mode occupation
numbers ˆn(k) [25].
Actually,  ˆρ
GGE
is not uniquely given by Eq. (24) for
this model.  Although the set{
ˆ
I
m
}defined by Eqs. (18)
and (19) is maximal, it isnot complete:  there exist local
conserved quantities
ˆ
I
′
thatcannotbe expressed as linear
combinations of the
ˆ
I
m
.  A simple example [5] of such a
quantity is
ˆ
I
′
=
∑
x
(−1)
x
(
ˆc
x
ˆc
x+1
+ ˆc
†
x+1
ˆc
†
x
)
.(26)
Ink-space,
ˆ
I
′
takes the form
ˆ
I
′
=
∑
k
e
−ik
ˆc(π−k)ˆc(k) + h.c..(27)
This  quantity  is  conserved  because  the  mode  spectrum
ω(k) =−coskof the hamiltonian
ˆ
H
0
(Eq. (16)) has the
symmetry
ω(k) =−ω(π−k).(28)
One can verify that
ˆ
I
′
does not commute with the
ˆ
I
m
, so
its existence does not contradict maximality of{
ˆ
I
m
}.
Note that the symmetry (28) is actually adegeneracy
of the spectrum|ω(k)|=|cosk|of positive-energy quasi-
particles of
ˆ
H
0
.  In general, the existence of “extra” local
conserved quantities such as
ˆ
I
′
—and the associated am-
biguity in the definition of the GGE—is related to degen-
eracies in the quasiparticle spectrum of the hamiltonian
[26].  We discuss the general relationship in Section V B.
One way to deal with an incomplete maximal set{
ˆ
I
m
}
is  to  simplycompleteit  by  adding  to{
ˆ
I
m
}additional
local  conserved  quantities,  such  as
ˆ
I
′
.   This  is  the  ap-
proach advocated by Fagotti [26], who studied this prob-
lem in significant detail.  The operators comprising the
expanded set will no longer be in involution, but one can
still  assign  to  each  one  a  Lagrange  multiplier  and  de-
fine  ˆρ
GGE
by maximizing the entropy subject to all con-
straints.  We obtain an expression identical to Eq. (24a),
but where the indexmranges over the complete set. This
maneuver is valid because local conserved quantities sat-
isfy a closed algebra [26] (of which the various maximal
sets are maximal abelian subalgebras).  The advantage of
this approach is that the resulting  ˆρ
GGE
depends on the
initial state only through the Lagrange multipliers{λ
m
}.
The primary disadvantage is that one can no longer write
ˆρ
GGE
in terms of a single set of mode occupation num-
bers, as in Eq. (24b).
Our  approach  to  this  problem,  which  we  describe  in
Section V B, is slightly different. In short, we retain ˆρ
GGE
in the original form (24), but allow the maximal commut-
ing set{
ˆ
I
m
}, or equivalently the set of mode occupation
numbers{ˆn
α
}, to depend on the initial state.  In this ap-
proach,  ˆρ
GGE
always has a mode number representation
similar to Eq. (24b); however, different classes of initial
states lead toinequivalentGGEs.
For  now,  we  can  ignore  these  subtleties,  because  we
assumed that the initial state  ˆρ
0
conserves total particle
number  (Eq.  (13)).   For  this  class  of  initial  states,  the
GGE is correctly given by Eqs. (24) and (25),  with
ˆ
I
m
defined in Eqs. (18) and (19), and ˆn(k) in Eq. (17).  We
leave  the  proof  of  this  assertion  as  an  exercise  for  the
reader.
C.    Relaxation of local observables:  preliminaries
Having  defined  the  GGE,  we  turn  to  the  relaxation
of  local  observables.    It  is  convenient  to  work  in  the
Heisenberg picture.  The operators representing observ-
ables evolve according to
ˆ
O(t) =e
i
ˆ
H

t
ˆ
Oe

where  locality  implies  that  all  sums  over  positions  are
restricted to a finite interval, and therefore that the ex-
pansion terminates at a finite order (because the space
of operators supported on a finite interval in a system of
fermions is finite dimensional).  Our simplifying assump-
tion (13) on the initial state means that we do not need
to consider non-number-conserving observables; their ex-
pectation values vanish identically.
Thus,  it  is  sufficient  to  study  the  relaxation  of  local
static2n-point correlation functions:

More generally, one might also considerdynamiccorre-
lation functions, in which the varioust’s are allowed to
be different.  These describe,  for instance,  the response
of the system to an external probe.
For systems with a Lieb-Robinson bound [27], there is a
general result [28] which states that, if the system relaxes
to a stationary state ˆρ
stat
ast→∞(as measured by local
static  correlations),  then  all  local  dynamic  correlations
are  also  described  by  ˆρ
stat
ast→ ∞.   In  this  section,
we will simply appeal to this result and concentrate on
static correlations.  But in fact,  most of our arguments
apply equally well to dynamic correlations, and we will
work  directly  with  the  latter  in  the  general  treatment
from  Section  III  onwards.   We  will  do  this,  despite  the
result  of  Ref.  [28],  for  two  reasons:  firstly,  to  keep  our
arguments self-contained,  and secondly,  because we are
interested not just in the limiting behavior of quantities
ast→∞, but also in the manner in which they relax to
those limits.
Note that the density operator ˆρ
GGE
is gaussian—it is
the exponential of a quadratic form in the creation and
annihilation  operators.   Therefore,  all  correlation  func-
tions computed with respect to ˆρ
GGE
Wick factorizeinto
products of two-point functions, and are determined en-
tirely by the latter:

Since the initial state ˆρ
0
need not be gaussian, the real
correlation  functions  certainly  need  not  behave  in  this
manner at early times.  To show relaxation to the GGE,
we  therefore  need  to  show  that,  as  time  progresses,  (i)
Wick factorization is recovered, and (ii) two-point corre-
lation functions approach their stationary GGE values.
In any state, such as  ˆρ
0
, one can also define thecon-
nected2n-point correlation function.  Roughly speaking,
this is the part of the 2n-point correlation function that
failsto  factorize  into  lower-point  correlation  functions.
For instance,

The general definition of connected functions is reviewed
in Appendix A. The vanishing of all connected (2n >2)-
point correlation functions is equivalent to Wick factor-
ization, as is evident from the formulae above:
(

.(41)
Therefore, we are led to study the relaxation of static
local connected 2n-point correlation functions:

These functions, and their dynamic brethren, will be the
primary objects of study in this paper.
We can now state precisely thecluster  decomposition
condition that the initial state  ˆρ
0
is assumed to satisfy
(in this section).  We assume that
〈〈ˆc

finite correlation length,  and where “f(x) =o(g(x)) as
x→a” means thatf(x)/g(x)→0 asx→a.  In the gen-
eral treatment of Section III onwards, we will significantly
weaken this assumption, and require onlyalgebraicdecay
(rather than exponential) of the initial connected corre-
lation functions (Eq. (43) will be replaced by Eq. (84)).

Thus,G

ing in Eq. (45),  may be identified as the single-particle
propagator  (the  amplitude  for  a  particle  added  to  the
vacuum at siteyto be found after timetat sitex).
Equation (45) also implies that

Thus,G
xy
(t)  can  also  be  identified  with  the  retarded
single-particle  Green’s  function  (if  the  hamiltonian  is
quadratic, this quantity is independent of the state  ˆρ
0
).
These interpretations are useful for guessing properties
ofG
xy
(t) in situations in which one cannot write down
a simple expression for it.  We will not need to rely on
intuition in this section, however.  In the limitL→ ∞,
one has

whereJ

(z) is the Bessel function of ordern∈Z.  The
magnitude of the propagator,|G
xy
(t)|, is plotted for var-
ious values oftin Figure 1.
We  will  show  in  the  following  that  the  leading  late-
time behavior of the connected (2n≥4)-point functions
(42)  is  actually  determined  by  very  basic  properties  of
the  propagator.   Basically,  all  that  matters  is  how  the
propagator “spreads out” with time.  Let us characterize
this “spreading out” more precisely.
Although|G
xy
(t)|itself is a rapidly oscillating function
ofx−yat fixedt,  its smooth envelope is nonzero and
slowly varying inside the “lightcone”|x−y|< t, and de-
cays exponentially to zero for|x−y|> t.  Qualitatively,
this can be seen by glancing at Figure 1.  More quantita-
tively, one can apply the method of stationary phase [29]
to the integral expression in Eq. (50) to obtain

wherer=x−y.  The|cos(···)|factor in Eq. (51) describes the lattice-scale oscillations of|G

(t)|; we replace it with
a constant to obtain the smooth envelope.
The two relevant properties of the propagator are that
the  interval  of|x−y|values  over  whichG
xy
(t)  is  non-
negligible grows linearly witht, and that the matrix ele-
ments ofG
xy
(t) inside this interval have a typical magni-

8
tude∝t
−1/2
. The second property can be extracted from
Eq. (51), but it can also be deduced very simply from the
first property, as follows.  Unitarity of time-evolution im-
plies thatG(t) is a unitary matrix:
1 =
∑
y
|G

We  can  restrict  the  sum  to  the  interval  over  which
|G

|G

Since the envelope of|G
xy
(t)|is nonzero and slowly vary-
ing within this interval, and since the interval grows lin-
early witht, one must have|G
xy
(t)|∼t
−1/2
.
E.    Decay of local connected(n≥4)-point functions.
“Gaussification”
We are now in a position to understand why Wick fac-
torization is recovered astincreases.  Consider the equal-

fails to Wick factorize.  Using Eq. (45) and its adjoint to
express the operators at timetin terms of operators at

〈〈ˆc

We can estimate the magnitude of this quantity by multi-
plying the number of significant terms in the sum by the
typical magnitude of each one. We have already seen that
|G
xy
(t)|is  negligible  outside  the  lightcone|x−y| ∼t,
and  that  it  has  typical  magnitude|G
xy

inside.    By  our  assumption  (43)  on  exponential  clus-
tering  of  correlations  in  the  initial  state,  the  function

(Eq. (56)).
Astincreases, there will be additional constructive or
destructive  interference  between  different  terms  in  the
sum of Eq. (55), that we have not taken into account in
our crude accounting.  Thus, we expect in general that

Thus, ast→ ∞, only the fully disconnected parts of
local correlation functions survive (the parts that factor-
ize  into  products  of  2-point  functions);  in  other  words,
we recover Wick factorization ast→ ∞.  As mentioned
above, this is the defining property of a gaussian density
matrix.  We conclude that, ast→∞, the “local state of
the system” may be described by a density matrix of the
form

We have shown that the state becomes “locally gaus-
sian” at late times.  Following Ref. [12], we refer to this
process  as  “gaussification”.   In  Section  IV  we  describe
gaussification  in  arbitrary  quadratic  lattice  models  by
generalizing the chain of reasoning leading from Eq. (45)
to Eq. (59).
F.    Equilibration of the local 2-point function to its
GGE value
It  remains  to  compute  the  local  equal-time  2-point
function,  and  to  verify  that  it  relaxes  to  its  stationary
GGE  value.   By  definition  of  the  GGE,  Eq.  (24),  this
stationary value is

〈ˆn(k)〉,(63)
where〈ˆn(k)〉is the expectation of the mode occupation
number ˆn(k) in the initial state.
The  results  of  this  subsection  depend  on  a  third
assumption  about  the  initial  state  ˆρ
0
,  in  addition  to
Eqs.  (13)  and  (43).   Roughly  speaking,  we  want  to  ex-
clude situations in which the initial profiles of local con-
served densities are inhomogeneous on length scales com-
parable to the system size—for instance, an initial state
in which sitesx= 1,2,...,L/2 are occupied by fermions
and the rest are empty.  True local equilibration in such
cases  occurs  on  timescales  of  orderL,  simply  because
that is how long it takes a locally conserved density to
flow across the system.
In order to formulate this assumption precisely, recall
that the local conserved quantities (Eqs. (18) and (19))
are of the form
ˆ
I
m
=
L
∑
x=1
ˆ
I
m,x
,(64)
where the density
ˆ
I
m,x
is supported on a finite interval
of  lengthbm/2cnear  sitex.   Define  the  “local  excess

We emphasize that the results of the previous subsec-
tions  hold  even  when  this  assumption  is  violated.   In
particular,  the  system  still  “gaussifies”  as  described  in
Section II E. Thus, if the initial state violates Eq. (66),
the natural description of the local state of the system
at  late  times  is  in  terms  of  a  time-dependent  gaussian
density matrix, given by Eqs. (60) and (61).
To  study  relaxation  of  the  2-point  function,  we  will
finally need to use the diagonal form (16) of the hamilto-
nian
ˆ
H

, or equivalently, the full form (45) of the propa-

Whent1,  we  may  apply  the  method  of  station-
ary  phase  to  estimate  the  time-dependent  pieces.   The
cleanest way to do this is to first takeL→ ∞, so that
1
L
∑
k
→
∫
dk
2π
,  and  only  then  taketlarge,  and  that  it
what we will do here.  However, we note in passing that
it is  also possible to  perform  a similar analysiswithout
first takingL→∞; one can use the Poission summation
formula to represent
1
L
∑
k
as a sum of integrals—each
integral corresponding to a translated copy of the finite
system—and then estimate each of these integrals by sta-
tionary phase.  As long ast < L/v
max
, wherev
max
is the
maximal group velocity of particles in the system, the ex-
tra translated integrals generate only exponentially small
(int) corrections to theL→∞result.
For completeness, let us briefly review the method of
stationary phase.  This method is described in detail in
many standard texts, such as Ref. [29].  A nice heuristic
and mathematically elementary treatment may be found
in section 3.3 of Ref. [30].  In the limitL→∞, Eqs. (72)
and (73) are both of the general form
I(t) =
∫
d
d
k
(2π)
d

iφ(k)t
,(74)
whereaandφare  smooth  functions.    Thek-integral
is  one-dimensional  in  Eq.  (72)  and  two-dimensional  in
Eq. (73).  In both cases,  the integral is over a compact
region without boundary.  Ast→∞, the dominant con-
tributions to theI(t) integral come from the vicinity of
pointsk

at  which∇

gives a contributionI

(t) toI(t) that can be obtained
(to leading order int) by expanding the phase function
φ(k) up through quadratic order in (k−k
j
), extending
the limits of thek-integral to infinity, and performing the
resulting gaussian integral; the result is

).   The  dots  are  subleading  terms  pro-
portional  to  higher  derivatives  ofa(k)  evaluated  atk
j
.
Terms withnderivatives are suppressed relative to the
leading term by an additional factor oft
−n/2
.
We obtainI(t) by simply adding up these contributions
(assumingφhas no other critical points):
I(t)∼
∑

I

Thus, whenever the phase functionφhas a finite number
of critical points, all of which are nondegenerate (and as-
suming that the amplitude functiona(k) does not vanish
at all of these points),
I(t)∼t
−d/2
ast→∞.(78)
This is the generic situation.
If,  however,φdoes  havedegeneratecritical  points,
their  contributions  must  also  be  accounted  for.    The
power  oftassociated  with  such  a  contribution  can  of-
ten  be  estimated  very  simply  as  follows.   Assume  that
k
∗
is  a  critical  point  at  whichφ(k)−φ(k
∗
)  has  a  zero
of  orderm,  whilea(k)  has  a  zero  of  ordern(that  is,
the  Taylor  expansions  of  these  functions  aboutk=k
∗
start  with  monomials  of  ordermandnrespectively).
In  spherical  coordinates  centered  atk

where  Φ  andAare  appropriate  functions  of  the  angu-

Note that largermleads to slower decay.  Thus, in the
(non-generic) case thatφhas degenerate critical points,
the  “most  degenerate”  of  these  will  typically  dominate
thet→ ∞behavior  ofI(t).   This  concludes  our  brief
mathematical interlude.
For  a  givenq
j
6=  0,  the  phase  functionφ(k;q
j
)  =
cos(k−q
j

two  distinct  nondegenerate  critical  points:k=k

these points, the method of stationary phase yields

A similar analysis applies to Eq. (73).  In this case, the
phase functionφ(k

) = cosk

has precisely
four  distinct  nondegenerate  critical  points:   (k

Note that the locations of the critical points ink-space
are determined by the dispersion relation of the hamil-
tonian
ˆ
H

, whereas the functionsf
j
(k) andf(k
1
,k
2
) are
determined  by  the  initial  state.   Therefore,  these  func-
tions  will  only  vanish  at  the  critical  points  for  special,
fine-tuned, choices of the initial state.  We conclude that,

We  have  now  explicitly  shown  that,  for  any  initial
state  ˆρ
0
that  satisfies  Eqs.  (13),  (43)  and  (66),  all  lo-
cal observables of the system relax to their values in the
GGE (24) ast→ ∞under time evolution generated by
ˆ
H
0
.   Furthermore,  we  have  obtained  the  exponents  of
the power laws governing the relaxation processes.  We
have shown that if the initial state has a density wave,
then we generically expect the system to relax first to a
(time-dependent) gaussian state like∼t
−1
, and then to
relax to the GGE like∼t
−1/2
.  In Section IV we describe
relaxation  of  the  local  2-point  function—and  hence  re-
laxation of a gaussified state to the GGE—in arbitrary
quadratic models, by generalizing the chain of reasoning
leading from Eq. (67) to Eq. (83).
Although  we  derived  them  for  the  specific  model  of
Eq. (11), the relaxation exponents 1/2 and 1 are actually
generic for quenches to clean quadratic fermion models
in one dimension.  Different exponents may be obtained
if  the  final  hamiltonian  is  fine-tuned  (so  that  the  dis-
persion relation has degenerate critical points) and/or if
the initial state is fine-tuned (so that the functionsf
j
(k)
andf(k
1
,k
2
) vanish at the critical points).  For instance,
Ref. [31] studied parameter quenches in a dimerized chain
and in the Kitaev model of a 1d spinlessp-wave super-
conductor, and obtained parameter-dependent relaxation
exponents for the 2-point function.  In all cases, however,
the  exponents  can  be  associated  to  degenerate  critical
points  and/or  to  the  vanishing  off
j
(k)  orf(k
1
,k
2
)  at
the critical points, and their values agree with the sim-
ple  estimate  (80)  (the  authors  of  [31]  perform  a  more
sophisticated steepest descent analysis to also obtain the
prefactors).  Moreover, one can easily verify that generic
small  perturbations  of  the  pre-quench  state  and  post-
quench hamiltonian cause the exponents to return to the
parameter-independent values 1/2 and 1.
Finally, we briefly comment on relaxation from initial
states that violate Eq. (66).  One might still expect the
conclusions  of  this  section  to  applylocally,  so  that  the
system relaxes as described above toward a “local GGE”
in  which  the  Lagrange  multipliers  are  slowly  varying
functions of position and time.  This “local GGE” would
in turn relax—over timescales comparable to the system
size—to the global GGE of Eq. (24),  in a manner con-
sistent with a generalized theory of hydrodynamics [32].
This is certainly a tempting picture, but because one can-
not associate a timescale to local power-law relaxation, it
is not immediately clear that such a description—based
on  separation  of  timescales—is  self-consistent.   We  will
not explore these questions further in this paper.
III.    GENERAL TREATMENT. SETUP AND
BASIC DEFINITIONS
A.    System
We consider a lattice system of fermions or bosons ind
dimensions, with one orbital per lattice site andNsites
in total (the generalization to multiple orbitals per site is
straightforward,  and  merely  complicates  the  bookkeep-
ing).  Let
ˆ
ψ
−
x
and
ˆ
ψ
+
x
= (
ˆ
ψ
−
x
)
†
denote the annihilation
and creation operators respectively for the site at posi-
tionx.
Although we work on a lattice, we believe that many
of  our  arguments  also  apply  in  the  continuum  limit,  if
the symbols in the equations are reinterpreted correctly;
in particular
ˆ
ψ
±
x
should be regarded as the operator that
creates or destroys a wavepacket at positionx.  With this
in mind, we will also make statements about relaxation
in systems of massless particles, etc.
B.    Initial state
At  timet=  0,  the  system  is  prepared  in  some  non-
equilibrium initial state represented by the density ma-
trix ˆρ
0
.  For the majority of this paper, the only condition
that we impose on  ˆρ
0
is that it have thecluster  decom-
positionproperty [24]:

12
least as rapidly as|x

when|x

for some >0.  The cluster decomposition property en-
sures that correlations in the state ˆρ
0
factorize as groups
of operators are taken far away from one another, and it is
quite reasonable from a physical standpoint.  The cluster
decomposition  property  (in  fact  a  stronger  exponential
version of it) has beenrigorously provenfor large classes
of  initial  states.   These  include  ground  states  of  inter-
acting local hamiltonians with a spectral gap [17, 18], as
well as thermal states of arbitrary short-ranged fermionic
lattice systems at sufficiently high temperature [19].  We
emphasize again that the initial state  ˆρ
0
need not be re-
lated in any way to the hamiltonian of the system.  For
instance, it can be the ground state or thermal state of
some  completely  differentinteractinghamiltonian;  the
only requirement is that it satisfy Eq. (84).
In  Sections  V C,  VI D  and  VII C,  we  will  require  the
initial state to satisfy a second condition, in addition to
cluster decomposition.  This extra assumption isneeded
in  these  three  sections  and  nowhere  else,  so we state it
when it first becomes relevant, in Section V C. In the rest
of the paper, only Eq. (84) is assumed.
C.    Hamiltonian
Fort >0, the evolution of the system is governed by
a quadratic, possibly time-dependent, hamiltonian of the
form
ˆ
H(t) =

for bosons/fermions
respectively.   This  is  the  most  general  possible  form  of
a quadratic hamiltonian.  The term involvinghaccounts
for hopping and on-site potentials, while the term involv-
ing ∆ allows for pairing.  In the bosonic case, we assume
that any linear terms have been eliminated by appropri-
ately  shifting  the  operators,  and  that  the  quasiparticle
spectrum of
ˆ
H(t) is positive-definite.
It is often convenient to organize the annihilation and
creation operators into a 2N-component column vector
ˆ
Ψ.   If  one  orders  the  sites  in  some  manner  from  1  to
N, and temporarily denotes the operators acting on site

blocks  are  the  matricesh=h

and  ∆  =±∆
T
with
componentsh

and ∆

(ordered to match the opera-
tors).  In the bosonic case, we requireH(t) to be positive-
definite at eacht(this is equivalent to requiring the quasi-
particle spectrum of
ˆ
H(t) to be positive-definite).
In general, we will refer to any 2N×2NmatrixMas

We  find  it  preferable  to  work  in  the  Heisenberg  pic-
ture throughout our analysis, so that the operators
ˆ
ψ

evolve with timet, while the unspecified density matrix
ˆρ

does not.
D.    Observables and relaxation
The   observables   of   interest   arelocal   correlation
functions;    by   this   we   mean   anyn-point   function

A density matrix  ˆρ

is gaussian if and only if, for each
n6=  2,  all  connectedn-point  functions  with  respect  to
ˆρ
′
vanish  (this  is  equivalent  to  Wick’s  theorem).   Any
gaussian state is therefore entirely determined by its 2-
point functions.
IV.    “GAUSSIFICATION” OF THE INITIAL
STATE
We will first study the relaxation, in the sense defined
above,  of  a  system  prepared  in  the  initial  state  ˆρ
0
and
evolving according to the quadratic hamiltonian (85), to

13
a state described by a gaussian density matrix.  Following
Ref. [12], we refer to this process as “gaussification”.
This section can be regarded as generalizing the logic
that led from Eq. (45) to Eq. (60) in Section II.
A.    Spreading of operators.  General properties of
the propagator
As stated earlier, we work in the Heisenberg picture.
Since the hamiltonian (85) is quadratic, the Heisenberg
equations  of  motion  for
ˆ
ψ
a
x
(t)  yield  a  system  oflinear
ordinary differential equations.  These may be written in
matrix form, following the notation of Eq. (87), as
∂
∂t
ˆ
Ψ(t) =−iM(t)
ˆ
Ψ(t),(91)
where
M(t) =
(
h(t)∆(t)
−∆
∗
(t)−h
∗
(t)
)
.(92)
Recall thath
†
=hand ∆
T
=±∆ for bosons (fermions).
Thus,  for  fermions,  the  matrixM(t)  =H(t)  is  always
hermitian, whereas for bosons it is only hermitian if ∆ =
0.   In  either  case,  one  may  immediately  integrate  this
matrix differential equation to obtain
ˆ
Ψ(t) =G(t)
ˆ
Ψ(0),(93)
which defines thepropagatorG(t); in generalG(t) is the
time-ordered  exponential  of  the  matrix-valued  function
M(t):

cases  it  is  the  time-ordered  exponential  of  a  hermitian
matrix-valued  function.   For  bosons  in  general,G(t)  is

to Section IV E.

also equals the retarded single-particle Green’s function
of the system (both normal and anomalous parts); with
a  quadratic  hamiltonian

.
Unitarity of the matrixG(t) ensures that

In  accordance  with  the  interpretation  ofG
ab
xy
(t)  given
above,  this  equation  may  be  understood  as  expressing
conservation of probability of particles along with holes.
Our  argument  for  “gaussification”  depends  only  on
very  coarse  properties  of  the  propagator—on  whether
and how rapidly it “spreads” as time progresses.  Let us
make  these  notions  precise.   Following  the  terminology
used in Ref. [12], we say that the dynamics aredelocaliz-
ingat (x,a) if
|G
ab
xy
(t)| →0    ast→∞ ∀(y,b);(97)
otherwise  we  say  that  the  dynamics  arelocalizingat
(x,a).
If the dynamics are delocalizing at (x,a), then for any
c >0, at sufficiently late timestone has|G
ab
xy
(t)|< cfor
all (y,b).  In order to satisfy Eq. (96),|G
ab
xy
(t)|must then
be nonzero for at least 1/c
2
pairs (y,b).  Thus, “delocal-
izing dynamics” requires spreading of the propagator.  In
order to quantify how rapidly this spreading occurs, con-
sider the smooth envelope

ab

(t)|,  obtained
by coarse-graining the latter inxandy(in the example
of Section II, for instance, we obtain
 ̃
G
xy
(t) by averaging
the curves in Figure 1 over their rapid oscillations on the
lattice scale).  For given positionx, indexa, timet, and
constantδ >0, define

sum toy∈ D
a

In  many  cases  of  interest,  including  lattice  systems
with Lieb-Robinson bounds [12, 27, 33],V
a
x
(t;δ) depends
much  more  weakly  onδthan  does(t,δ)  in  the  limit
δ→0 (a glance back at Figure 1 shows that this is true in
the example of Section II). In order to satisfy Eq. (100),
the  non-negligible  componentsG
ab
xy

the regiony∈D

|G

for typicaly∈D

If the dynamics are delocalizing, one must haveV
a
x
(t)→
∞ast→∞.
Usually,  the  dimensiond
′
of  the  regionD
a
x
(t)  equals
the dimensiondof the ambient space.  However, there are
also cases in whichd
′
< d.  For instance, for a system of
massless  particles  with  an  isotropic  dispersion  relation,
D
a
x
(t)  is  thed
′
=  (d−1)-dimensional  surface  of  ad-
dimensional sphere centered atx.
Before  proceeding,  let  us  comment  on  three  generic
ways in which the dynamics may fail to delocalize:
1. The  most  obvious  one  is  that
ˆ
Hdescribes  a  system
that  is  Anderson  localized  [34];  in  this  case  the  dy-
namics are localizing at all pointsx.
2. More  generally,  imagine  that  the  quasiparticle  spec-
trum of
ˆ
Hincludes a level whose wavefunction is ex-
ponentially  localized  in  space  near  positionx
0
.   The
propagatorG
ab
xy
(t)  will  then  include  a  term,  due  to
the  localized  state,  that  does  not  vanish  ast→ ∞.
However, this contribution will be exponentially small
in the distances|x−x
0
|or|y−x
0
|if either of these
is large.  Thus, to an excellent approximaiton, the dy-
namics will only be localizing very nearx
0
,  and will
remain delocalizing elsewhere. We will discuss the spe-
cial effects that arise when the quasiparticle spectrum
of
ˆ
Hcontains one or more localized states, in addition
to extended states, in Section VI. For the remainder
of the paper, we exclude this possibility.  Because we
define relaxation as alocalphenomenon, however, our
general conclusions also apply to systemswithlocal-
ized  states,  as  long  as  we  consider  a  region  of  space
that is sufficiently far from them.
3. Finally, consider a system of non-interacting particles
moving in two dimensions in a constant perpendicular
magnetic field.  In this case,  the dynamics are again
localizing; the propagatorG(t) is a periodic function
of time [35].  This may be inferred from the fact that,
in the classical problem, all particles move in circular
orbits at the cyclotron frequencyω
0
=eB/mc, regard-
less of their initial velocity (heremis the mass ande
the charge of each particle,Bis the magnitude of the
magnetic  field,  andcis  the  speed  of  light).   Conse-
quently, the wavefunction of a single particle prepared
in a wavepacket at some pointr
0
simply expands and
contracts rhythmically with period 2π/ω
0
.

We  are  interested  inlocalcorrelation  functions,  so  we
assume  that  thex

’s  are  all  close  to  one  another  (rel-
ative  to  the  size  of  the  system).   We  can  estimate  the
magnitude of the connectedn-point function by simply
multiplying the number of significant terms in the sum by
the typical magnitude of each one.  Based on the discus-
sion  in  Section  IV A,  the  summand  is  negligible  unless

effects at the end of this section.
Withlocalizingdynamics  (as  in  quenches  to  disor-

sult  depends  crucially  on  the  ratio  of  the  localization

, cluster
decomposition plays no role, and one expects little or no
relaxation to occur.  One can also consider the intermedi-
ate case in which the dynamics has both a localizingand
a delocalizing component.  We study this in some detail
in Section VI.
A  slight  refinement  of  the  argument  just  presented
allows  us  to  handle  initial  states  in  which  the  corre-
lation  lengthξis  infinite,  but  which  nevertheless  obey
the weaker algebraic form of cluster decomposition (84).

important  point  is  that  this  leading  term  is  a  constant

estimate of the relaxation rate of the connectedn-point

the correlation length, if this is finite, or the length scale
beyond which the initial connectedn-point functions ex-

16
hibit the power law decay required by cluster decompo-
sition).
Notice  that  Eq.  (109)  does  not  give  any  information
about  the  relaxation  behavior  of  the  2-point  function,
since  the  exponent  ofV(t)  vanishes  whenn=  2.   This
is easily understood.  As we saw in the example of Sec-
tion  II,  and  as  we  will  show  later  in  generality,  the  re-
laxation of the 2-point function is governed by interfer-
ence  between  the  terms  in  the  sum  in  Eq.  (104).   This
interference was completely ignored in our derivation of
Eq. (109), which relied only on gross phase space argu-
ments.  Forn >2, we hypothesize that the neglected in-
terference effects merely lead to an additional oscillatory
time-dependence about the power-law decay exhibited in
Eq. (109),withoutmodifying the exponent of the power
law itself.
C.    Relaxation power laws
Equation  (109)  gives  estimates  of  the  leading  time-
dependence of all local (n >2)-point connected functions
of the system in terms of the coarse spreading behavior
of the propagator (as encoded in the functionV(t)).  Al-
though a detailed study of possible spreading behaviors is
beyond the scope of this paper, we describe some generic
types of spreading below.
Typical spreading behaviors fall into two broad classes.
In the first class, which we call “volume spreading”, the
smooth envelope
 ̃
G
ab
xy
(t) of the propagator (as defined in
Section IV A) is non-negligible for most pointsyinside a
d-dimensional region of characteristic sizer(t) centered
at positionx, so thatV(t)∼[r(t)]
d
.  In the second class,
which we call “area spreading”,
 ̃
G
ab
xy
(t) is non-negligible
only for pointsynear the (d−1)-dimensional surface of
such a region of sizer(t) centered atx,  so thatV(t)∼
[r(t)]
(d−1)
.  In either case, the dynamics are delocalizing
ifr(t)→ ∞ast→ ∞,  and localizing if not (with the
exception  of  area  spreading  ind=  1,  a  case  that  we
discuss separately in Section IV D).
We expect behavior of the “volume” type for massive
particles in a slowly varying potential (dispersivespread-
ing) and of the “area” type for massless particles (non-
dispersivespreading).   In  both  these  cases,r(t)∼vt,
wherevis the maximum local group velocity of the par-
ticles.  In the presence of weak disorder, we again expect
behavior of the “volume” type.  Ind≥3 dimensions, the
expectation isdiffusivespreading of the formr(t)∼
√
Dt
(hereDis the diffusion constant), while ind= 1 and 2 di-
mensions the expectation is thatr(t) saturates at a finite
localization length,r(t)∼ξ
loc
ast→∞[36].  These four
paradigmatic spreading behaviors are depicted schemat-
ically  in  Figure  4.   The  corresponding  relaxation  expo-
nents may be easily obtained using Eq. (109).
For  a  time-independent  hamiltonian
ˆ
Hwith  a  Lieb-
Robinson  bound  [27,  33],  we  expect  the  propagator  to
genericallybehave  in  one  of  these  manners;  in  the  ex-
ample of Section II, for instance, the propagator exhib-
ited  what  we  are  now  calling  dispersive  spreading  (of
course,  there  are  exceptions,  such  as  the  pathological
ones  noted  in  Section  IV A).  More  complicated  behav-
ior is certainly possible for time-dependent hamiltonians
ˆ
H(t), but generically we expect that these will still lead
to spreading of either the “volume” or “area” types, with
some characteristic sizer(t) that must be computed on
a case-by-case basis.
If the hamiltonian
ˆ
Hcontains non-local terms, so that
there is no Lieb-Robinson bound, we cannot say as much
about the envelope of the propagator.  However, the uni-
tarity  condition (96)  still  relates the  typical  magnitude
of non-negligible matrix elementsG
ab
xy
(t) to the volume
V(t) of the region on which the propagator is meaning-
fully supported:G
ab
xy
(t)∼[V(t)]
−1/2
.  Since,  in the ab-
sence of a Lieb-Robinson bound, we expectV(t) to grow
quite rapidly, the basic argument of Section IV B still ap-
plies, and we expect the system to “gaussify” rapidly (as
measured by local operators).
Therefore,  if  the  hamiltonian  describes  a  delocalized
system  in  the  sense  thatr(t)→ ∞ast→ ∞,  then
all  local  (n≥3)-point  connected  functions  decay  with
the power laws obtained above,  and the system can be
described at late times by a gaussian density matrix.  As
mentioned  earlier,  there  is  one  important  exception  to
this result, which we now discuss.
D.    Non-dispersive spreading ind= 1dimension:
absence of gaussification
Recently,  Sotiriadis  [37]  has  analytically  studied  the
quench  dynamics  of a  massless  free bosonic  scalar  field
in one spatial dimension, and has shown that the system
always retains significant memory of non-gaussian initial
correlations.  Thus, the system fails to relax to the corre-
sponding bosonic GGE, which is gaussian.  A very similar
result was obtained earlier by Ngo Dinh et al. [38].
This result can be understood very easily within the
framework that we have established above.  The propa-
gator of massless particles is supported entirely along the
light cone.  Ind= 1 dimension, at each instant of time,
the light cone simply consists of two points.  Therefore,
unitarity implies that the propagator can never decay; it
follows from the analogue of Eq. (104) that higher con-
nected correlation functions never relax to zero.
More generally, for any system whose propagator ex-
hibits “area spreading”, we haveV(t)∼[r(t)]
(d−1)
, and
so|G

a gaussian state.  It is important to keep in mind, how-
ever, that the observables for massless particles are typ-
ically not correlation functions of the fields themselves,

behaviors shown may be regarded as “typical”.
that the precise arguments and decay rates for these are
slightly  different.   We  will  not  delve  into  these  details
here.
Many properties of (seemingly diverse) gapless systems
in one spatial dimension can be obtained within the uni-
fying framework of Luttinger liquid theory [39], which, in
its simplest incarnation,  can be formulated as a theory
of non-interacting massless bosonic fields.  However, this
formulation  relies  on  linearization  of  the  single-particle
dispersion relation, and while this is innocuous for most
static properties, it is clearly dangerous when considering
relaxation behavior: even a slight dispersion nonlinearity
will cause a crossover from non-dispersive to dispersive
spreading  of  the  propagator  at  late  enough  times,  and
hence  lead  to  the  relaxation  that  is  absent  in  the  free
massless bosonic field theory.  Thus,  any consistent de-
scription  of  the  quench  dynamics  of  a  one-dimensional
system (even an exactly integrable one) using Luttinger
liquid theorymustaccount for dispersion nonlinearities
[40, 41], unless the initial state is itself gaussian in terms
of the bosonic fields [42].
These points were emphasized by Ngo Dinh et al. [38],
and  also  by  Sotiriadis  [43]  in  follow-up  work  to  [37].
These references contain a comprehensive analysis of re-
laxation in the Luttinger model, and conclude that any
weak nonlinearity of the dispersion would ultimately lead
to  gaussification,  in  agreement  with  the  intuitive  argu-
ment sketched above.  We refer the reader to these works
for a detailed discussion of most of the issues mentioned
in this subsection, and to Ref. [42] for a general pedagog-
ical discussion of quenches in the Luttinger model.
E.    Bosons with pairing
We now comment on how our “gaussification” results
are modified in the case of bosons with pairing.  As noted
in Section IV A, the propagator for bosons has the general
form
G(t) =Te

and  whereh

propagator is not unitary, but ratherpseudo-unitary; it
satisfiesG
†
η G=η, whereη=I

andI

is the
N×Nidentity  matrix.   Consequently,  the  right  hand
side of Eq. (96) is no longer simply 1,  but rather some
function of time:

In general,g(t) could be a complicated function of time,
whose  form  is  difficult  to  predict  without  some  further
knowledge ofM(t).  However, if the hamiltonian is time-
independent,  we  can  easily  derive  the  bound  (see  Ap-
pendix B for details)

whereω

min
>
0  is  the  smallest  eigenvalue  of  the  hermitian  matrixH
that defines the hamiltonian via Eq. (87) (recall that, for
bosons, we requireHto be positive-definite). In this case,
although the relaxation behavior described by Eq. (113)
is complicated, it has a power-law envelope determined
entirely byV(t).
Time-evolution in bosonic systems approximately de-
scribed by unstable or metastable quadratic hamiltonians
(those whose mode spectra arenotpositive-definite) has
been studied in Ref. [44].
V.    EQUILIBRATION TO THE GGE
We have shown in Section IV that, if the initial state
has the cluster decomposition property (84), and if the

18
dynamics are delocalizing in the sense of Eq. (97), then,
ast→ ∞, all local (n >2)-pointconnectedcorrelation
functions relax to zero in a manner given by Eq. (109).
Thus,  ast→ ∞,  local correlation functions themselves
Wick factorize and are determined entirely by the local
2-point function〈

(t)〉, up to corrections of order
1/V(t).   All  the  results  of  Section  IV  hold  for  general
time-dependent quadratic hamiltonians
ˆ
H(t).
If
ˆ
His  time-independent,  we  can  go  further—as  we
do  now—and  show  that  the  system  locally  equilibrates
to  the  appropriate  GGE.  In  Sections  V A  and  V B,  we
construct  the  GGE  density  operator  and  show  that  it
is  gaussian;  these  sections  generalize  and  complete  the
discussion  in  Section  II B.  In  Section  V C,  which  gen-
eralizes  Secton  II F,  we  study  equilibration  of  the  local
2-point function to its GGE value.  Combined with the
results summarized in the previous paragraph, this anal-
ysis proves equilibration to the GGE for a wide class of
quadratic lattice models,  and also furnishes predictions
for  the  leading  time-dependence  of  local  observables  as
t→∞.  A similar analysis is carried out for time-periodic
ˆ
H(t) in Section VII.
A.    Conserved quantities
Consider any quadratic time-independent hamiltonian
ˆ
Hwhich gives rise to delocalizing dynamics.  We begin
by showing that in this case all local conserved quantities
ˆ
I
m
are themselves quadratic in the particle creation and
annihilation operators.
By definition of the conserved quantities, we must have
ˆ
I
m
(t) =
ˆ
I
m
(0).  Without loss of generality, we can take
ˆ
I
m
to have a definite ordernin terms of creation and an-
nihilation operators, because the latter evolve linearly:

The same “phase space” arguments that we used in the
previous section to show decay of all local connected (n≥
3)-point  functions  also  apply  to  the  right  hand  side  of
Eq. (118);  locality of the coefficientsI

here plays
the role of cluster decomposition.  We conclude that for
n≥3, the right hand side of Eq. (118) must vanish as
t→ ∞if the dynamics are delocalizing.  The left hand
side, however, is obviously time-independent and finite.
This contradiction proves the claim.
Thus,  all  local  conserved  quantities  of
ˆ

The mode occupation number operators  ˆn

commute
with
ˆ
Hand with one another.  If the spectrum{ω
j
}is
nondegenerate (that is, ifω
i
=ω
j
impliesi=j), then the

19
set of operators{ˆn
j
}is uniquely defined, and forms a lin-
ear basis for the set of all quadratic conserved quantities
of
ˆ
H.  We have already shown (in the previous section)
that all local conserved quantities
ˆ
I
m
of
ˆ
Hare quadratic
if
ˆ
Hgives  rise  to  delocalizing  dynamics.   Therefore,  in
this case we may conclude that the GGE density opera-
tor has the form

)
,(127b)
where  only  the  Lagrange  multipliers{λ
m
},  or  equiva-
lently{μ

}, are left to be determined by the initial state.
We emphasize again that this conclusion relies on two as-
sumptions in addition to
ˆ
Hbeing quadratic:  (i) that the
dynamics  are  delocalizing  and  (ii)  that  the  mode  spec-
trum{ω
j
}is nondegenerate.
If  the  mode  spectrum  is  degenerate,  on  the  other
hand, there is some freedom in the choice of diagonaliz-
ing canonical transformationS, and consequently in the
mode operators and conserved quantities.  For instance,
ifω
1

, consider the family of quasiparticle operators
defined by
(

)
=Q
(
ˆγ

ˆγ

,(128)
whereQ∈U(2) is any 2×2 unitary matrix.  It is clear
that the new number operators

also commute with the hamiltonian

H.  However, theydo
notin general commute with the old ˆn

operators:
[
ˆ
H,ˆn
′
j
]

[
ˆn
i
,ˆn

]
6= 0(i,j= 1,2).(130)
Therefore, the primed (ˆn
′
) and unprimed (ˆn) operators
yieldinequivalentsets of conserved quantities.  This am-
biguity  is  fundamental  [26]—it  is  present  whenever  the
mode spectrum is degenerate—and it leads, in principle,
to additional dependence on the initial state, as we now
describe.
Each inequivalent set of conserved quantities gives rise
to its own family of GGE density operators (parameter-
ized  by  the  Lagrange  multipliers  of  that  set  of  quanti-
ties).  Given an initial state ˆρ
0
, we must chose the canon-
ical transformationSto also diagonalize the correlations
within each degenerate subspace; that is, we must choose
Sso that, for all pairsi6=jsuch thatω
i
=ω
j
, we have
〈ˆγ

ˆγ
−
j
〉
:

(
ˆγ

)
= 0.(131)
In the case of fermions, we must also chooseSto ensure
that, wheneverω
i
=ω
j
= 0,
〈ˆγ
+
i
ˆγ
+
j
〉= 0.(132)
It is always possible to find a canonical transformation
Sthat diagonalizes
ˆ
Hand also satisfies these conditions.
The GGE density operator can then be constructed us-
ing the associated mode operators in the usual manner,
following Eq. (127b).
Thus in general  ˆρ
GGE
, written in the form (127b), de-
pends on the initial state ˆρ
0
in two distinct ways:  (i) the
definition of the occupation numbers operators{ˆn
j
}cor-
responding to degenerate modes{ω
j
}of
ˆ
H, and (ii) the
values of the Lagrange multipliers{μ
j
}.
The general construction of the GGE density operator
that we have outlined in this section can be applied to any
quadratic hamiltonian
ˆ
Hthat gives rise to delocalizing
dynamics;  it  will  indeed  yield  a  density  operator  ˆρ
GGE
that correctly describes all local observables of the sys-
tem at late times (as we demonstrate in the next section).
However, we have in some sense “cheated” by phrasing
our general construction in terms of the mode occupation
numbers{ˆn
j
}rather than in terms of the local conserved
quantities{
ˆ
I
m
}.  Since we are studyinglocalrelaxation,
the latter are really the quantities of fundamental impor-
tance.
From  a  more  fundamental  point  of  view,  then,  a  set
{ˆn
j
}isadmissibleonly if, by taking linear combinations
of the ˆn
j
, one can construct a maximal set of local con-
served quantities{
ˆ
I
m
}(recall that the set{
ˆ
I
m
}is maxi-
mal if any local conserved quantity
ˆ
Ithat commutes with
all of the
ˆ
I
m
can be expressed as a linear combination of
them).   Given  a  maximal  set{
ˆ
I
m
},  we  can  always  ob-
tain a corresponding admissible set{ˆn
j
}by finding the
Bogolyubov transformationSthat simultaneously diag-
onalizes the
ˆ
I
m
.  Sets{ˆn
j
}that areinadmissiblecan—
regardless of the initial state—be ignored for the purpose
of  writing  down  ˆρ
GGE
,  and  one  only  needs  to  use  ini-
tial  correlations  to  distinguish  between  admissible  sets.
Thus, the construction outlined in this section, although
valid, might overestimate the degree to which the GGE
depends on the initial state.
C.    Relaxation of the local 2-point function
Having constructed the GGE density operator, we now
study  relaxation  towards  it  by  analyzing  the  long-time
behavior of the local 2-point function.  As in the exam-
ple of Section II, this part of the analysis requires us to
make  an  additional  assumption  about  the  initial  state
ˆρ
0
;  roughly  speaking,  we  need  to  exclude  situations  in
which the initial profiles of local conserved densities are
inhomogeneous on length scales comparable to the sys-
tem size.  True local equilibration in such cases occurs on
timescales of the order of the linear dimensionLof the
system, simply because that is how long it takes a locally
conserved density to flow across the system.
In order to formulate this assumption precisely, recall

20
that the local conserved quantities are of the form
ˆ
I
m
=
∑
x
ˆ
I
m,x
,(133)
where  the  density
ˆ
I
m,x
is  supported  in  a  finite  region
centered at positionx.  Define the “local excess density”
δI
m
(x
0
;r)
:
=

Vol(B

)
∑

whereB
r
(x

) is thed-dimensional ball of radiusrcen-
tered  atx
0
,  Vol(B
r
)  is  the  volume  of  this  ball,  and
Vol(Sys) is the volume of the entire system.
We  assume  that  these  excess  densities  can  be  made
small by takingrsufficiently large (but keepingrfixed
as Vol(Sys)→∞):
∃r:δI
m
(x
0
;r) =O(r
−d
)∀x
0
,m
as  Vol(Sys)→∞.(135)
We emphasize that the “gaussification” results of Sec-
tion IV hold even when this assumption is violated (the
results of Sections V A and V B hold as well). Thus, if the
initial state violates Eq. (135), the natural description of
the local state of the system at late times is in terms of
a time-dependent gaussian density matrix, of the form
ˆρ
1
(t) =
1

(

Eq. (89)) that must be chosen so that

for all pairs of indicesa,b=±and positionsx,ywith
|x−y|finite in the limit of infinite system size.
Also as in the example of Section II, this part of the
analysis  requires  more  detailed  knowledge  of  the  spec-
trum  of  the  hamiltonian,  or  equivalently,  of  the  propa-
gator,  than  is  needed  to  show  “gaussification”.   Conse-
quently, our treatment will be somewhat schematic.
In terms of the matrixSof the Bogolyubov transfor-
mation

the propagator may be written as

and{ω

tions.  This form ofG(t) is valid for both fermions and
for bosons; the difference between the two is the unitar-
ity  or  pseudo-unitarity  of  the  matrixS.   It  is  standard
to regard the 2Ncolumns ofSas eigenvectors of a ficti-
tious single-particle problem whose eigenvalue spectrum
is symmetric about zero (while keeping in mind that, for
bosons, the eigenvectors are orthonormal with respect to
η=I
N

rather thanI
2N
).  If we label these eigen-
vectors by their energyε(ε=±ω

Equations  (141–144)  are  the  obvious  generalizations  of
Eqs. (67), (68) and (63).
In the limit of large system size, the spectrum{ε}will
in general consist of a continuous part due to spatially
extended quasiparticle states and a discrete part due to
localized states.  For now, we assume that all quasipar-
ticle states are extended.  We will discuss what happens
when the spectrum includes a discrete part coming from
localized states in Section VI (see also the comments in
Section IV A).
Since the spectrum is by assumption purely continuous
in the limit of large system size, the sums overεandε
′
in Eq. (141) become integrals in this limit (whether the
other quantum numbersσare discrete or continuous is
less important).  Thet→ ∞asymptotics of the (ε,ε
′
)-
integral is then determined by the analytic structure of
the functionF.  This structure can in turn be deduced
from  general  arguments  of  the  type  used  in  Section  II.
Inverting the Bogoliubov transformation, we have
F(ε,σ;ε

The sums overxandyin Eq. (145) may be performed
with respect to the central coordinate (x+y)/2 and rel-
ative coordinate (x−y).  The sum over the relative co-
ordinate converges absolutely (due to clustering of corre-
lations), whereas the central coordinate is summed over

21
the whole system (because the states are extended).  It
follows thatFcan become singular only along “curves”
in (ε,σ;ε
′
,σ
′
)-space, which we may identify with the zero
sets of appropriate functionsC
j
(ε,σ;ε
′
,σ
′
). The most ob-
vious such curve is the trivial one, (ε

) = (ε,σ), which
may  be  identified  with  the  functionC
0
(ε,σ;ε

(ε−ε

can  occur  if  the
initial state has an appropriate order (in Section II, for
instance, we found that such curves were present if the
initial  state  had  a  density  wave  with  nonzero  wavevec-
torq).  We conclude thatFhas the (highly schematic)
general form

The behavior of the integral ast→ ∞can be extracted
from a straightforward stationary phase analysis (apart
from the factore
−i(ε−ε
′
)t
, the integrand is a smooth func-
tion  of  the  integration  variables).   The  phase  function
φ(ε,ε
′
) = (ε−ε
′
) clearly lacks stationary points, so the
dominant contribution to the integral ast→ ∞comes
from thecornersof the (ε,ε
′
)-integration region.  Near
each corner, the smooth functionfcan be regarded as a
function ofσandσ
′
alone.  The integrals overσandσ
′
will then yield factors proportional to the (local) density
of statesg(ε) andg(ε
′
) near the band edges.  We are led
to conclude that, ast→∞,
δC(t)∼(#)×

∫
dεg(ε)e
−iεt
∣

∣

If, as is often the case, the density of states near the band
edge has the form
g(ε)∼ε
s
,(150)
then
∫
dεg(ε)e
−iεt
∼t
−(1+s)
∫
dz z

e
−iz
, and we obtain
the estimate
δC(t)∼t
−2(1+s)
.(151)
This result assumes thatfdoes not vanish at the corners
of the (ε,ε
′
)-integration region.  Generically, this will be
the case.  In special fine-tuned  circumstances,  in  which
fdoes vanish at the corners, the exponent of the power
law may be larger (more negative).
We can perform a similar stationary phase analysis of
eachδC
j
term in Eq. (147).  In this case, the phase func-
tionφis the restriction of (ε−ε
′
) to the curveC
j
.  Ifφ
is  nonstationary  along  this  curve,  and  if  the  curve  ter-
minates at the boundary of the (ε,ε
′
) integration region,
then  the  same  reasoning  that  we  applied  toδCin  the
previous paragraph yields the estimate
δC
j
(t)∼t
−(1+s)
.(152)
Again, this result may be modified if the initial state or
final hamiltonian are fine-tuned.  More complicated time-
dependence will occur if the phase functionφis station-
ary somewhere along the curveC
j
; such a contribution,
if  present,  will  likely  dominate  thet→ ∞relaxation
behavior.  However, this must be analyzed on a case-by-
case basis, and we will not attempt to make any further
statements about the general case.
If the hamiltonian
ˆ
His translation-invariant, then one
typically has
g(ε)∼ε
(d/2−1)
(153)
at each band edge, wheredis the dimension of space.  In
this case the above estimates become
δC(t)∼t
−d
,(154a)
δC
j
(t)∼t
−d/2
.(154b)
The  results  obtained  in  the  example  of  Section  II—
Eqs. (81) and (82)—are recovered if one setsd= 1.
It  is  interesting  to  compare  Eq.  (154),  which  gives
the  asymptotic  relaxation  of  the  2-point  function  in  a
translation-invariant  lattice  system,  to  the  asymptotic
power law with which such a system should gaussify ac-
cording  to  the  results  of  Section  IV.  The  latter  power
law  is  set  by  the  lowest  nonvanishing  (n >2)-point
connected  correlation  function.   Assuming  that  this  is
n= 4, Eq. (109) suggests that the system gaussifies like∼
[V(t)]
−1
, whereV(t) is the volume on which the 1-particle
propagator is meaningfully supported.  In a translation-
invariant  lattice  model,  the  propagator  spreads  at  the
maximal group velocity, so we expect this volume to grow
likeV(t)∼t
d
. Hence we conclude that the system gaussi-
fies like∼t
−d
.  If there is a density wave of one or more of

22
the conserved quantities in the initial state, thenδC
j
(t)
terms are present in the 2-point function; these relax like
∼t
−d/2
by Eq. (154b).  Thus the systemfirst  gaussifies
like∼t
−d
, and then relaxes to the GGE like∼t
−d/2
.  If,
on the other hand, the initial state lacks such order, then
only  theδC(t)  term  is  present  in  the  2-point  function;
this  relaxes  like∼t
−d
by  Eq.  (154a),  sogaussification
and relaxation to the GGE both occur with the power law
∼t
−d
.
Notice  that  gaussification  and  relaxation  of  the  2-
point  function  are  controlled  (in  translation-invariant
systems) by fundamentally different aspects of the band
structure:   gaussification  is  controlled  by  the  maximal
group velocity—typically a property of the middle of the
band(s)—whereas  relaxation  of  the  2-point  function  is
controlled by the density of single-particle levels at the
band edge(s).
VI.    EFFECTS DUE TO LOCALIZED STATES
Assume now that the quasiparticle spectrum of
ˆ
Hcon-
tains, in the limit of large system size, both discrete local-
ized states and a continuum of extended states.  We can
write the diagonalizing Bogoliubov transformation as
ˆ

tinuum level with energyω≥0 and additional quantum
numbersσ; the operator ˆγ

A.    The propagator
The propagator splits naturally into two pieces:
G(t) =G
ext
(t) +G
loc
(t),(157)
where the first pieceG
ext
(t) involves only the extended
states, and the second pieceG
loc
(t) involves only the lo-
calized states.  For fermions,
[G

.(159)
For bosons, one must multiply the integrand in Eq. (158)
by−bsgn(ε), and the summand in Eq. (159) bybc.
The  dynamics  of  the  propagatorG(t),  as  defined  in
Section IV A, are thus in general the sum of adelocalizing
part, due toG
ext
(t), and alocalizingpart, due toG
loc
(t).
We have already discussed general properties ofG
ext
(t)
in  Sections  IV A  and  IV C.  Let  us  now  briefly  discuss
general properties ofG
loc
(t):
Each leveljof the discrete spectrum is exponentially
localized near some positionx
j
; in other words,
R
ac
xj
∼e
−|x−x
j
|/ζ
j
for|x−x
j
|&ζ

,(160)
whereζ
j
>0  is  the  decay  length.It  follows  from
Eq. (159) that
[G
loc
(t)]
ab
xy
∼e
−|x−y|/ζ
x
for|x−y|&ζ
x
,(161)
whereζ
x
is roughly the largest decay length of the states
localized nearx.  Thus, [G
loc
(t)]
ab
xy
is negligible whenever
|x−y| ζ
x
.   Given  a  positionx,  we  may  restrict  the
sum overjin Eq. (159) to those levels that are localized
within a few decay lengthsζ
j
ofx, because the remaining
levels  give  negligible  contributions.   Finally,  for  fixedx
andy, the propagator [G
loc
(t)]
ab
xy
oscillates forever with-
out decaying ast→∞.
B.    Gaussification
Having  understood  how  the  propagator  is  modified,
let us study how the localized states affect gaussification
and  the  conclusions  of  Section  IV.  Consider  the  time-
dependent  connectedn-point  function.   Equation  (104)
becomes

where〈〈···〉〉
k−loc
contains all terms in Eq. (162) that have
kfactors ofG

and (n−k) factors ofG

.

23
We have already studied the contribution〈〈···〉〉
0−loc
,
in  which  all  the  propagators  areG
ext
,  in detail  in  Sec-
tion  IV B.  Ast→ ∞,〈〈···〉〉
0−loc
decays  to  zero  as  de-
scribed  by  Eq.  (109).   Next,  consider  the  contribution
〈〈···〉〉
1−loc
, in which a single propagator isG
loc
.  Accord-
ing to the discussion above,  this contribution is signifi-
cant (at any timet) only if one or more of thex
i
are lo-
cated within a few decay lengths of a localized state.  The
sum over the correspondingy

is restricted by the prop-
agator [G

a
i

.   Repeating  the  analysis  of  Section  IV B,  the  sums
over  the  relativey-coordinates  converge  absolutely  due
to cluster decomposition, so the entirey-sum yields a fi-
nite,t-independent contribution ast→ ∞.  Meanwhile,
typical matrix elements of the propagators are of order
G
ext
(t)∼[V(t)]
−1/2
andG
loc
(t)∼1/ζ

.  We conclude
that, ast→∞,
〈〈···〉〉

−(n−1)/2
.(164)
This decay isfaster, by a factor of [V(t)]
−1/2
, than that
of〈〈···〉〉

By similar reasoning, we conclude that
〈〈···〉〉
k−loc
∼[V(t)]

(k≥1).(165)
Note  that,  fork≥1,〈〈···〉〉
(k+1)−loc

.(169)
Each  sum  overj
i
in  Eq.  (169)  may  be  restricted  to
those levels that are localized nearx
i
, in accordance with
our  previous  discussion.    It  is  evident  that  the  local-
ized  contribution  is  negligible  ast→ ∞if  and  only  if
〈〈ˆγ
c

j
1

2
···ˆγ

〉〉itself  is  negligible.   In  bosonic  systems
prepared in generic initial states,  this condition will be
violated as soon as there is a single localized level.  This is
because thenth cumulant of the occupation of this level,
〈〈(ˆγ
+
ˆγ
−
)
n
〉〉,  will  be  nonzero  in  general.   In  a  fermionic
system, on the other hand, the occupation of a single lo-
calized level is characterized entirely by the expectation
value〈ˆγ
+
ˆγ
−
〉, so these higher cumulants all vanish.
Thus, consider a system of fermions in which the quasi-
particle spectrum of
ˆ
Hcontains, in addition to a contin-
uum of extended states, a set of discrete levels{j}that
are localized near positions{x
∗
j
}with decay lengths{ζ
j
}.
Assume that the initial state  ˆρ
0
has a finite correlation
lengthξ, and that for each pair (i,j) of localized levels,
|x
∗
i
−x
∗

| ξ+ζ

.  Then any connected function in-
volving the operators of two distinct levelsi6=j, such as
〈〈ˆγ

tion involving three or more operators of thesamelevel,
such as〈〈ˆγ
a

ˆγ
b
j
ˆγ

j
···〉〉, vanishes identically. It follows that
all〈〈···〉〉
(k>2)−loc
contributions to the connectedn-point
function are negligible.  Since thek= 0,2 terms decay
in the same manner with time, and since thek= 1 term
decays faster than either of them, we reach the following
somewhat surprising conclusion:
Discrete localized levels in the quasiparticle spectrum
of a quadratic fermion hamiltonian
ˆ
Hhave  a  negligible
effect on gaussificationif (i) the initial state has a finite
correlation lengthξ, and (ii) the spatial distance between
any pair of localized levels is large relative toξ.
C.    GGE density operator
Next, we study how the localized states affect the con-
clusions  of  Section  V.  Before  considering  equilibration,
we must revisit the construction of the GGE density op-
erator itself.
In Section V A, we showed that, for any quadratic time-
independent hamiltonian
ˆ
Hwhich gives rise to delocal-
izing dynamics, all local conserved charges
ˆ
I
m
are them-
selves quadratic in the particle creation and annihilation
operators.   Let  us  see  how  this  argument  changes  with
localized states.  Equation (118) remains valid, but each
propagator factor now has an extended piece and a lo-
calized piece:

whereI
k−loc
(t) contains all terms in Eq. (170) that have
kfactors ofG
loc
(t) and (n−k) factors ofG
ext
(t).  Re-
peating the arguments of Section VI B, we conclude that
forn >2,  only  theI
n−loc
(t)  contribution  survives  as
t→∞.  Then, Eq. (171) requires thatI
n−loc
actually be
time-independent, and thatI=I
n−loc
.  It is clear that
the  corresponding  local  conserved  quantities  are  those
that can be built from the quasiparticle operators ˆγ
±
j
of
the localized levels:
ˆ

n
∑
i=1
c

i
= 0.(172)
In addition, the participating levels{j
i
}must all be local-
ized in the same region of space (otherwise
ˆ
I
m
will not be
local).  Conversely,alllocal conserved charges involving
products ofn >3 creation or annihilation operators must
be of this form.  Thus, in a bosonic system, the existence
of even a single localized level leads to non-quadratic lo-
cal conserved charges (powers of the occupation of this
level, (ˆγ
+
ˆγ
−
)
n
).  In a fermionic system, however, one can
only  construct  non-quadratic  local  conserved  charges  if
there  are  two  or  more  localized  levels  close  enough  to
one another in space (how close depends on how local we
want the charges to be).
We conclude that, in a quadratic bosonic system, the
GGE (defined in terms of local conserved quantities) is
gaussian if and only if there are no localized levels at all,
whereas  in  a  quadratic  fermionic  system,  the  GGE  re-

localized levels do exist, as long as they are located suf-
ficiently far apart in space.  In the latter case, the mode

of these levels are local
conserved charges, and must be included in  ˆρ

.  The
general analysis of Section V B does not require modifi-
cation.
D.    Equilibration to the GGE
Finally,   let  us  consider  equilibration.As  in  Sec-
tion V C, we must make an additional assumption on the
initial state, Eq. (135), to exclude situations in which the
initial profiles of local conserved densities are inhomoge-
neous on length scales comparable to the system size.
Following Section VI B, we may identify three contri-
butions to the equal-time 2-point function:

, in detail in Section V C. It generically
relaxes to its GGE value ast→∞in a manner described
by Eq. (151) or (152), and this relaxation is due to “in-
terference” effects.  On the other hand, the 1−loc piece
vanishes  ast→ ∞for  simpler  “phase  space”  reasons:
the results of Section VI B, in particular Eq. (164), show
that

This piece is fully off-diagonal in the quasiparticle basis
of
ˆ
H, so its GGE value is also zero.
Therefore,  we  only  need  to  study  the  fully  localized
(2−loc) piece.  It is given by (compare Eq. (169)):

Dynamics generated by a quadratic fermion hamilto-
nian

Hwhose  quasiparticle  spectrum  includes  discrete
localized levelswill  still  lead  to  gaussification  and  equi-
libration  to  the  GGE, as long as (i) the initial state has
a finite correlation lengthξ, and (ii) the spatial distance
between any pair of localized levels is large relative toξ.
VII.    TIME-PERIODIC HAMILTONIANS AND
THE “FLOQUET-GGE”
Our  arguments  for  gaussification  in  Section  IV  were
extremely general; they relied only on clustering of cor-
relations in the initial state, and on spreading of the prop-
agatorG(t).  Thus, they apply to any quadratic hamilto-
nian
ˆ
H(t), as long as it leads to delocalizing dynamics.
In  this  section,  we  consider  the  particularly  interesting
time-periodiccase:
ˆ
H(t) =

ˆ
Ψ
†
H(t)
ˆ
Ψ + constant,(178)

where
H(t) =

)
=H(t+T),(179)
and where, as before, the plus (minus) sign is for bosons
(fermions).
ˆ
H(t) describes a periodically driven, or “Flo-
quet”, closed quantum system.
A.    Floquet theory basics
Let us briefly review some simple facts about this prob-
lem [46].  In order to give a complete “stroboscopic” de-
scription of the system at timest=nT(n= 0,1,2,···)
one only needs to know the time-evolution operator over
a single period,
ˆ
U(T) =Te
−i
∫
T
0
ˆ
H(t
′
)dt
′
(180)
(to describe the system at intermediate times,  one also
needs  to  know
ˆ
U(t)  for  all  0< t < T).   Since
ˆ
U(T)  is
unitary, it has a spectral decomposition of the form
ˆ
U(T) =
∑
α

−i
α
T
|α〉〈α|,(181)
where{|α〉}forms a basis for the Hilbert space of the sys-
tem, and where the “quasienergies”

are defined mod-
ulo 2π/T.  The associated “Floquet hamiltonian”
ˆ

ˆ
H
F
is  quadratic  because
ˆ
H(t)  is
quadratic  (quadratic  forms  in  fermion/boson  operators
form a Lie algebra, and the unitary group is compact).
Thus, apart from the subtlety that the quasienergies{
α
}
take values on a circle rather than on the real line, the
dynamical problem at timest=nTis formally identical
to one with a time-independent quadratic hamiltonian

B.    Propagator and gaussification
Recall that the propagatorG(t) is defined by the solu-
tion of the Heisenberg equations of motion,
ˆ
Ψ(t) =G(t)
ˆ
Ψ(0).(186)
Since
ˆ
Ψ(t)

H(t

ˆ
H

, one obtains two equivalent ex-
pressions for the propagator over one period:
G(T) =Te

where

and
M

.(189)
As one might expect for a quadratic system,G(T) com-
pletely determines
ˆ
H
F
(modulo shifting the quasienergies
by multiples of 2π/T).
The propagator at any timet=nT+t
′
,  where 0≤
t

< T, is given by
G(nT+t
′
) =G(t
′
)[G(T)]
n
.(190)
Ast→∞, the relaxation behavior will be dominated by
the [G(T)]
n
factor, except possibly in some pathological
cases.   Therefore,  we  expect  any  local  connected  3-  or
higher-point  function  of  the  driven  system  to  relax  (or
fail  to  relax)  with  time  in  exactly  the  same  manner  as
that of an undriven system with hamiltonian
ˆ
H
F
, up to
a multiplicative periodic factorf(t) =f(t+T) coming
from  theG(t
′
)  part  of  the  propagator.   The  results  of
Sections IV C, IV D and IV E may thus be applied with
only minor modifications.
C.    Relaxation to the Floquet-GGE
Having discussed gaussification in the Floquet context,
let  us  next  consider  the  eventual  fate  of  the  effectively
gaussian state.  Following Section V B, we may construct
a  GGE  density  operator  ˆρ
F
out  of  the  local  conserved
charges  of  the  Floquet  hamiltonian
ˆ
H
F
;  the  argument
of  Section  V A,  applied  at  stroboscopic  timest=nT,
shows that these charges are all quadratic, so that  ˆρ
F
is
indeed gaussian.  It is natural to suspect that the system
eventually relaxes to a state described by  ˆρ
F
.  Note that
such a state is alimit cycle:  for any operator
ˆ
O, one has
Tr
(
ˆ
O(t) ˆρ
F
)
= Tr
(
ˆ
U(T)
ˆ
O(t+T)
ˆ
U
†
(T) ˆρ
F
)
= Tr
(
ˆ
O(t+T) ˆρ
F
)
(191)
(the second equality follows from the definition of  ˆρ
F
),
but in general
Tr(
ˆ
O(t) ˆρ
F
)6= Tr(
ˆ
O(t
′
) ˆρ
F
).(192)
This  time-periodic  limiting  state  has  been  called  the
“periodic  Gibbs  ensemble  (PGE)”  or  theFloquet-GGE
[20, 21, 47].

26
We can generalize the analysis of Section V C to study
relaxation of the gaussified state to the Floquet-GGE. It
is sufficient to study this at stroboscopic timest=nT.
As in Section V C, we must make an additional assump-
tion on the initial state, Eq. (135), to exclude situations
in  which  the  initial  profiles  of  local  conserved  densities
are  inhomogeneous  on  length  scales  comparable  to  the
system size.  Equations (138–147) are unchanged, except
thatSmust now be understood as the matrix of the Bo-
goliubov  transformation
ˆ
Ψ  =S
ˆ
Γ  that  diagonalizes  the
Floquet hamiltonian
ˆ
H
F
, andεas a quasienergy defined
modulo 2π/T.
First consider the limit of very fast driving,T→0.  In
this limit, we expect that we can ignore the periodicity
ofε(since the period 2π/T→ ∞), and that the quasi-
particle states of
ˆ
H
F
are organized into one or more well-
defined bands.  If this is so, the remainder of the analysis
in Section V C applies, and we conclude that the gaussi-
fied state relaxes to ˆρ
F
with a power law; in the simplest
cases, this power law is given by Eq. (151) or (152).
Next consider the opposite limit of very slow driving,
so thatT→∞and
ˆ
H(t) is a slowly varying function of
t.   On  timescalest.T,  we  expect,  based  on  an  adi-
abatic  approximation  and  our  arguments  in  the  time-
independent  case,  to  observe  power-law  relaxation  to  a
GGE of the instantaneous hamiltonian
ˆ
H(t).  On much
longer timescalestT, the Floquet drive becomes im-
portant, and we except to eventually observe relaxation
to the Floquet GGE, ˆρ
F
.  Stationary phase analysis sug-
gests  that  this  relaxation  will  beexponentialin  time,
∼e
−t/T
.  To see this, consider Eq. (148).  The quasiener-
giesεare  defined  on  a  circle  of  radius  2π/T→0,  so
the  spectrum  is  likely  to  be  relatively  smooth,  without
well-defined bands.  Therefore

any  power  of  (t/T)  as  (t/T)→ ∞.   Similar  arguments
apply toδC

(t).
Thus, in the limitT→0 of fast driving, we expect to
observe power-law relaxation to  ˆρ
F
, the (time-periodic)
GGE  of  the  Floquet  hamiltonian
ˆ
H
F
.   In  the  opposite
limitT→∞of slow driving, we expect to observe power-
law relaxation toward a GGE of the instantaneous hamil-
tonian
ˆ
H(t), followed by much slower exponential relax-
ation∼e
−t/T
toward  ˆρ
F
.   It  is  more  difficult  to  make
semi-quantitive general statements about the regime of
intermediate driving, and we leave this as an interesting
question for future work.
VIII.    A COMMENT ON SPIN MODELS
MAPPABLE TO QUADRATIC FERMION
MODELS
Everything that we have said also applies to any spin
system  that  can  be  mapped  to  a  quadratic  model  of
fermions (via a Jordan-Wigner transformation or other-
wise), assuming (i) that the observables of interest map
to local operators in terms of the fermions, and (ii) that
the initial state  ˆρ
0
obeys cluster decompositionwith  re-
spect to the fermion operators.  It is by no means obvious
that  a  given  physical  initial  state,  which  obeys  cluster
decomposition with respect to spin operators, also does
so with respect to the fermions.  It would be interesting
to identify which states have this property.
IX.    CONCLUSIONS
We  have  presented  a  general  framework  for  under-
standing relaxation phenomena in systems described by
quadratic  fermion  or  boson  hamiltonians  that  may  or
may  not  be  time-dependent.   We  have  shown  that,  as
long as the hamiltonian yields delocalizing dynamics, and
for any initial state that satisfies a condition on algebraic
clustering of correlations, all local operators of the system
relax  to  values  consistent  with  a  gaussian  state  at  late
times—the  system  “gaussifies”.   Furthermore,  we  have
shown that gaussification can be understood as a simple
consequence of the spreading of operators in real space,
and  that  the  exponents  of  the  power  laws  with  which
quantities  gaussify  can  be  extracted  from  the  smooth
envelope  of  the  one-particle  propagator  of  the  system
(which  does  not  depend  on  the  initial  state).   In  this
sense, gaussification in quadratic systems appears to be
quite universal in character.
Using similar arguments, we have given a simple proof
that  all  local  conserved  quantities  of  a  quadratic  time-
independent hamiltonian with delocalizing dynamics are
themselves quadratic,  and hence that the GGE density
operator of such a system is gaussian.  We have described
how to construct the GGE out of mode occupation num-
bers in a manner that properly accounts for degeneracies
in the mode spectrum.  Under an additional assumption
on the initial state (needed to avoid having to deal with
hydrodynamic timescales comparable to the system size),
we have shown that the local 2-point function of the sys-
tem  relaxes  to  its  GGE  value  with  a  power  law  whose
exponent can typically be extracted from the local den-
sity of single-particle levels at the band edge.  Combined
with our gaussification results, this proves relaxation to
the GGE for a large class of quadratic systems and a large
family of initial states, and also gives quantitative infor-
mation about how local observables relax.  We find that,
if the initial state has a density wave of some conserved
quantity, the system generically relaxes first to a gaussian
state, and then, with a smaller inverse power of time, to
the GGE. If the initial state isnotordered in this sense,

27
“gaussification”  and  relaxation  to  the  GGE  occur  with
the same powers of time and cannot be distinguished as
easily in general.
We have also studied situations in which these conclu-
sions break down, such as the case of free massless bosons
in  one  dimension  [37,  43],  or  when  the  mode  spectrum
of  the  hamiltonian  includes  localized  levels,  and  have
explained  precisely  why  the  breakdown  occurs  in  these
cases.  We have argued that, perhaps unexpectedly, well-
separated localized levels in a system of fermions do not
hinder gaussification or relaxation to the GGE. Finally,
we  have  applied  our  arguments  to  the  case  of  periodi-
cally driven systems, and have shown that the relaxation
of such systems to the Floquet-GGE can also be under-
stood semi-quantitatively within our framework.
NOTE ADDED
Shortly after a preprint of this work was first posted,
another preprint presenting closely related and comple-
mentary  results  appeared  [48].   Our  work  places  more
emphasis  on  physical  intuition,  and  on  estimating  in
a  simple  manner  the  exponents  of  the  power  laws  by
which local observables relax in quadratic models, while
Ref. [48] places more emphasis on rigorous results and er-
ror bounds.  The methods used are also different (though
related in spirit):  where we employ the stationary phase
approximation, Ref. [48] uses the machinery of Kusmin-
Landau bounds.

Most interferometers operate with photons or dilute, non-condensed cold atom clouds in which
collisions are strongly suppressed.  Spinor Bose-Einsteincondensates (BECs) provide an alternative
route toward realizing three-mode interferometers; in this realization, spin-changing collisions pro-
vide a resource that generates mode entanglement.  Working in the regime where the pump mode,
i.e., them= 0 hyperfine state, has a much larger population than the sideor probe modes (m=±1
hyperfine states),f= 1 spinor BECs  approximate SU(1,1) interferometers.  We derive analytical
expressions within the undepleted pump approximation for the phase sensitivity of such an SU(1,1)
interferometer for two classes of initial states:  pure Fockstates and coherent spin states.  The inter-
ferometer performance is analyzed for initial states without seeding, with single-sided seeding, and
with double-sided seeding.  The validity regime of the undepleted pump approximation is assessed
by performing quantum calculations for the full spin Hamiltonian.  Our analytical results and the
associated  dynamics are expected to guide experiments as  well as  numerical studies that explore
regimes where the undepleted pump approximation makes quantitatively or qualitatively incorrect
predictions.
I.  INTRODUCTION
Quantum enhanced measurement protocols or quan-
tum metrology refer to improving the precision mea-
surement of a physical parameter or physical parame-
ters using quantum protocols [1, 2].  Nowadays, quan-
tum metrology is a powerful workhorse across physics,
including areas as diverse as gravitational wave detec-
tion [3–5]; sensing applications [6] such as magnetome-
try [7, 8], gravitometry [9], and electric field determina-
tions [10]; optical communication [11]; and image recon-
struction [12, 13].
A classical approach for improving the estimation
would repeat the measurement onNidentical but inde-
pendent systems or uncorrelated particles. For single pa-
rameter estimations, such an approach leads to a 1/
√
N
scaling, which is typically referred to as standard quan-
tum limit [4] or shot noise limit [14, 15]. Beyond (i.e., bet-
ter than) the standard quantum limit performance can
be achieved by taking advantage of quantum resources.
Caves pointed out in 1981 [4] that squeezed states can
improve the performance to a 1/Nscaling.  Motivated
by the heuristic phase-particle number Heisenberg un-
certainty relation ∆θ∆N≥1, Holland and Burnett [16]
referred to the 1/Nperformance as “Heisenberg limit”.
Unfortunately, unique definitions of the standard quan-
tum limit and the Heisenberg limit are not available [2].
Quite generally, to specify these limits, the classical re-
sources need to be defined and the improvement of the
parameter estimation due to the additional quantum re-
sources needs to be quantified.

Assuming a generic set-up that consists of three
components—(i) input, (ii) “actual device”, and (iii)
measurement and parameter estimation—one can at-
tempt to improve the performance by optimizing either
of the three components listed above. The present work
focuses on quantifying the performance of a paradigmatic
device, namely an interferometer, using established for-
mulations for the parameter estimation: the phase sen-
sitivities ∆θ
QCR
and ∆θ
ep
that are, respectively, derived
from the quantum Cramer-Rao bound [17–19] and error
propagation [1].
The interferometer considered is an SU(1,1) interfer-
ometer based on af= 1 spinor Bose-Einstein conden-
sate (BEC) [20, 21] with three internal hyperfine compo-
nents, namely the hyperfine states with projection quan-
tum numbersm= +1,m= 0, andm=−1 (fde-
notes the total spin angular momentum of the atom). An
SU(1,1) interferometer can be constructed by replacing
the passive beam splitters in a Mach-Zehnder interferom-
eter by active non-linear parametric amplifiers, which can
generate quantum correlations and entanglement [14].
Our study is motivated by the quest to get a handle
on the role played by correlations and entanglement of
the initial state and of the state during the amplification
step. Given a device and parameter estimation scheme,
how does the absolute performance depend on the initial
state?  Given a certain class of initial states, what are
the device parameters that yield the best absolute phase
sensitivity? Besides providing general insight and being
important for studies in the regime where the undepleted
pump approximation holds, our results are expected to
provide guidance for spinor BEC based interferometer
studies that operate outside the SU(1,1) regime.
Treating the spinor BEC in the single-mode approxi-
mation [22] and further working in the undepleted pump
approximation [23], we report explicit analytic expres-

2
sions for the phase sensitivity and a number of auxiliary
observables for two classes of initial states: pure Fock
states and coherent spin states. We consider the situa-
tions where all atoms are in them= 0 state and the side
modes are empty (“vacuum state” [24]), the majority of
atoms is in them= 0 state and either them= +1 mode
orm=−1 mode has a small population (single-sided
seeding), and the majority of atoms is in them= 0 state
and them= +1 andm=−1 modes both have small
populations (double-sided seeding). For selected observ-
ables, we present analytic expressions for an arbitrary
pure initial state. Physical interpretations of the analyt-
ical expressions are presented. The validity regime of the
undepleted pump approximation is assessed by simulat-
ing the entire interferometer sequence for the full spin
Hamiltonian numerically.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Sections II A and II B introduce the spin Hamiltonian
that underlies this work and the basic operating principle
of a spinor BEC based interferometer, respectively. The
parameter estimation procedures considered in this work
are introduced in Sec. II C and the undepleted pump ap-
proximation is introduced in Sec. II D. The equations of
motion within this approximation and their solutions are
introduced in Secs. III A and III B and explicit analytical
results for the side mode population and the correspond-
ing fluctuation are presented in Sec. III C. Section IV an-
alyzes our analytical results. Two classes of initial states
are considered: pure Fock states (see Sec. IV A) and co-
herent spin states (see Sec. IV B). Finally, Sec. V presents
a conclusion.
II.  PROBLEM DEFINITION AND
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
A.  Full spin Hamiltonian
Our description accounts for the three hyperfine states
of anf= 1 spinor BEC consisting ofNatoms within the
single-mode approximation, which assumes that the spa-
tial degrees of freedom are integrated out [22, 25]. As a
result, the dynamics is governed by the spin Hamiltonian
ˆ
H
spin
, which treats each atom as a structureless spin-1
“object” that undergoes two-bodys-wave collisions [25],

The first term on the right hand side of Eq. (1) describes
spin-changing collisions, also referred to as spin-mixing
dynamics; this term is identical to the four-wave mixing
term in nonlinear quantum optics [14]. The second term
on the right hand side of Eq. (1) corresponds to the col-
lisional shift and the third term is a single-particle shift.
For reasons that will become clear in Sec. II B, we refer
to this term of the Hamiltonian as linear phase shifter

B.  Spinor BEC interferometer
The three-mode spinor BEC interferometer takes an
initial state|Ψ(0)i, time evolves it under the spin Hamil-
tonian
ˆ
H
spin
, and then performs a measurement or mea-
surements that form the basis for determining the phase
sensitivity [see Fig. 1(a)]. In our work,|Ψ(0)iis a pure
state; more generally, one could consider a mixed initial
state ˆρ(0). The time evolution is, as shown in Fig. 1(b),
divided into three time intervals of lengthst
1
,t

, andt

.

which is referred to as “state preparation”, applies

3.,  the  dynamics  is  governed  by
ˆ

to right, the hyperfine statesm= +1,m= 0, andm=−1.
The population of them= 0 mode is much larger than that
of them=±1 side modes.  Spin-changing collisions play an
important role during steps 1.  and 3.  of the interferometer
sequence but are turned off during step 2..
If an appropriate Fano-Feshbach resonance [28] ex-
ists, the linear phase shifter Hamiltonian can be
realized by tuningcto zero.  In the absence of
Fano-Feshbach resonances, the linear phase shifter
Hamiltonian can be realized approximately by op-
erating in the regime where|q|≫|c|.

The mean numberN

interferometer performance, which is quantified by the
phase sensitivity (see Sec. II C for details). We define

C.  Quantifying the interferometer performance
To quantify the interferometer performance, we con-
sider two different quantities, namely ∆θ
ep
and ∆θ
QCR
.
We emphasize that the discussion in this section is spe-
cific to the situation where the phase imprinting is based
on the linear phase shifter Hamiltonian. Non-linear phase
imprinting protocols modify how the various limits scale
with the number of (active) atoms [19, 29, 30].
The phase sensitivity ∆θ
ep
is obtained through error
propagation,
∆θ
ep

|∂

.(11)
Since it is evaluated att=t
1
+t
2
+t
3
, it depends on all
three steps of the interferometer sequence as well as the
initial state. The fact that ∆θ
ep
is fully determined by
the characteristics of the side mode population makes it
readily accessible to cold atom experiments.
A stringent limit on the parameter estimation is set by
the phase sensitivity ∆θ
QCR
, which is derived from the
quantum Cramer-Rao bound [1, 17],
∆θ
QCR

Here,F
Q
denotes the quantum Fischer information. For
the interferometer with linear phase shifter, the quantum
Fischer information depends on|Ψ(t
1
)iand the genera-
tor
ˆ
N
s
/2 that is associated with the linear phase shifter
Hamiltonian. Importantly, the phase sensitivity ∆θ
QCR
is independent of the readout step. In general, one finds
∆θ
ep
≥∆θ
QCR
[|Ψ(t
1
)i,
ˆ
N
s
/2],(13)
i.e., the quantum Cramer-Rao bound provides a lower
bound for the error propagation based sensitivity estima-
tor. For pure states|Ψ(t

)iand linear phase imprinting
generated by
ˆ
N
s

.(14)
Ideally, one would like to operate in the regime where the
quantity ∆θ
ep
/∆θ
QCR
is close to one, i.e., in the regime
where the error propagation based sensitivity ∆θ
ep
is as
close as possible to the best achievable phase sensitivity.
For comparison, we also report the Heisenberg limit
∆θ
HL
, which we take to be defined in terms of the number
N
s
(t
1
) of atoms in the side modes at timet
1
,
∆θ
HL
=
1
N
s
(t

)
;(15)

4
N
s
(t
1
) can be thought of as the number of “active atoms”
during the phase imprinting stage of the SU(1,1) inter-
ferometer. In this context, it is worthwhile mentioning
that there exist a variety of definitions and interpreta-
tions of the Heisenberg limit [1, 17–19, 24, 29–32]. Sec-
tion IV shows that the SU(1,1) interferometer with linear
phase imprinting allows for situations where the quan-
tum Cramer-Rao bound based phase sensitivity, which
provides a strict lower bound, is larger than the Heisen-
berg limit defined in Eq. (15), thereby underpinning the
notion that the Heisenberg limit, as defined in Eq. (15),
should not be interpreted as defining the ultimate or best
achievable performance.
D.  Undepleted pump approximation
The interferometer sequence introduced in Sec. II B
has, in general, to be modeled numerically. Analytical
results can, however, be obtained within the undepleted
pump approximation (UPA) [23, 24, 33], which replaces
the operators ˆa
†
0
and ˆa
0
by the square-root of the mean
number
N
0
of particles in them= 0 mode at timet= 0,
N
m
=hΨ(0)|
ˆ
N
m
|Ψ(0)i.(16)
The approximation is consistent with considering a large
reservoir of atoms in them= 0 pump mode. Physically,
the undepleted pump approximation assumes that the
majority of atoms occupies them= 0 pump mode. This
places restrictions on the initial state and on the operat-
ing timet
1
+t
2
+t
3
of the interferometer, since only a
small fraction of the atoms should get pumped (i.e., scat-
tered) into them= +1 andm=−1 side modes during
the time evolution.
Dropping the constant energy shift−c(

Since the Hamiltonian
ˆ
H
UPA
can be written in terms of
the elements of the SU(1,1) group, the resulting interfer-
ometer is an SU(1,1) interferometer. It is important to
realize that
ˆ
H
UPA
does not conserve the particle number.
In the context of photons, this is very natural. In the con-
text of spinor BECs as considered in this paper, this is
not natural since the number of atoms is, neglecting one-
, two-, and higher-body losses, conserved. We elaborate
on this discussion in Sec. IV B and Appendix C.
Looking ahead, we also define the simpler “resonant”
Hamiltonian
ˆ
H
UPA,r
, which assumes that the collisional
and Zeeman shifts cancel each other, as a special case.

Our analytical results presented in Secs. III and IV
are obtained for the standard three-step sequence of the
SU(1,1) interferometer, which is identical to the sequence
introduced in the previous section with

A.  Equations of motion
To simulate the SU(1,1) interferometer sequence dis-
cussed in the previous section, we work in the Heisenberg
picture. The equations of motion for the time-dependent
operators ˆa

then read [14]

Cov(

It follows from Eqs. (34) and (35) that the interfer-
ometer performance depends on two aspects:  (i) the
initial state through the quantities

,∆N
s
,P,∆P,
Cov(

device through

Aand
 ̃
Bare, within
the undepleted pump approximation, fully determined
by the five dimensionless parametersξ
1
,ξ
3
,χ
1
,χ
3
, and
θ. Importantly, the first term on the right hand side of
Eq. (34) and the first term inside the square root sign of
Eq. (35) depend only on the interferometer device while
all other terms “mix” the interferometer device and the
initial state.
We can also look at the quantum Cramer-Rao bound
1/∆N
s
(t
1
).  Equations (34) and (35) yieldN
s
(t
1
) and
∆N
s
(t

) if

A
, andγ
 ̃
B
are replaced byA
1
,B
1
,
γ
A

, andγ

1
, respectively.  It follows thatN
s
(t
1
) de-
pends, within the undepleted pump approximation, on
the initial state only through
N
s
andP, i.e., the ini-
tial seeding and the initial “pair correlation”.  If
N
s
and
Pare zero,N
s
(t

) grows exponentially with increas-
ing|ξ

is real. Maximal growth is obtained for
q
1
=q
c,1
(corresponding toχ
1
= 1), with a growth rate
of
N
0
c
1
/(N~). The regime whereN
s
(t
1
) grows exponen-
tially is referred to as dynamical instability [34]. Since
the fluctuation ∆N
s
(t
1
) depends on the initial state, the
quantum Cramer-Rao bound as well as ∆θ
ep
can be con-
trolled, at least partially, by adjusting the initial state.
D.  Special cases
The solutions presented in Secs. III B and III C simplify
significantly for the resonant case, i.e., whenq
j
is set to
q
c,j
and
ˆ
H
UPA
reduces to
ˆ
H
UPA,r
. Columns 1 and 2 of
Table I summarize selected expressions for two resonant
cases (χ

3
= 1), namely the resonant symmetric
interferometer for whichξ=ξ
1
=ξ
3
and the resonant
asymmetric interferometer for whichξ
1
6=ξ
3
.  In the
former case, the interferometer is fully characterized by
the dimensionless parameterξand the phaseθ; this case
has been considered in Ref. [24] for the vacuum state. In
the latter case, the interferometer is fully characterized
by the two dimensionless parametersξ
1
andξ
3
and the
phaseθ; this case has been considered in Ref. [23] for a
class of density matrices.
The solutions also simplify notably for the non-
resonant symmetric interferometer for whichξ=ξ
1
=
ξ
3
6= 1 andχ=χ
1
=χ
3
. In this case, the interferometer
is fully characterized by the two dimensionless parame-
tersξandχas well as the phaseθ. This case has been
considered in Ref. [35] and selected expressions are sum-
marized in column 3 of Table I.

has a time reversal symmetry if the initial state

(in this case,γ

IV.  EXPLICIT RESULTS FOR VARIOUS
INITIAL STATES
This section considers two typical classes of initial
states|Ψ(0)i: pure Fock states are discussed in Sec. IV A
and coherent spin states in Sec. IV B. Selected properties
of these two initial states are summarized in Table II.
Even though our analytical results within the undepleted
pump approximation are derived in the Heisenberg pic-
ture, this section takes the view point that the initial
state is propagated in time and that the operators are
time independent.
TABLE II. Properties of the initial states|Ψ(0)iconsidered in Sec. IV: vacuum state (VS), pure Fock state with single- and
double-sided seeding (PFS,S and PFS,D), and coherent spin state with single- and double-sided seeding (CSS,S and CSS,D).
The results are obtained within the undepleted pump approximation.

Let the initial state be a pure Fock state (PFS) with
N

atoms in modem,
|Ψ(0)i=|
N

0

i.
This initial state describes a system with
Natoms, where
N=N
−1
+N

+N

. We refer to|0,N
0
,0ias “vacuum
state” (VS) [24].  The naming originates from the fact
that the side modes, sometimes also referred to as probe
modes, are initially empty.  The vacuum state can be
interpreted as a special case of a pure Fock state or a
special case of a coherent spin state (see Sec. IV B). The
spin mixing dynamics during step 1. of the interferometer
sequence can evolve the vacuum state to a state with
significant entanglement [24]. If one or both of the side
modes contain non-zero occupation at timet= 0, we
refer to the initial state as seeded Fock state. Single-sided
seeding is realized if
N
+1
orN
−1
is non-zero and double-
sided seeding if
N
+1
andN
−1
are non-zero. We refer to
the resulting states as pure Fock state with single-sided
seeding (“PFS,S”) and double-sided seeding (“PFS,D”),
respectively.
To calculate the phase sensitivity ∆θ

Equations (43) and (44) show that initial seeding leads
to an enhancement of the number of atoms in the side
modes at the end of the interferometer sequence (i.e.,
speeds up the dynamics) and also enhances the quantum
fluctuations. Physically, this can be interpreted as be-
ing due to Bose enhancement as a consequence of the
non-zero initial seeding
N
s
.  The quantum fluctuation
∆N
s
(t

) does not only depend on
N
s
but, for
double-sided seeding, also on the actual distribution of
the atoms among the two side modes, i.e., the value of
N
+1
N
−1
. As shown in Eq. (47), a non-zeroN

N

leads
to a degradation of the phase sensitivity of the SU(1,1)
interferometer.
As an example, Fig. 3 compares our analytical re-
sults obtained within the undepleted pump approxima-
tion (solid lines) with the results obtained by evolving
the initial state under the full spin Hamiltonian
ˆ
H

Eq. (1), through exact diagonalization (dashed lines) for
a

Na condensate with

the undepleted pump approximation captures the time
dependence ofN

[see Fig. 3(a)] and ∆N
s
[see Fig. 3(b)]
well forξ

.4 (for the parameters employed, this cor-
responds tot
1
.40 ms).  Forξ
1
&4, the undepleted
pump approximation results deviate not only quantita-
tively but, rather quickly, also qualitatively from the ex-
act numerical results.  From a practical point of view,
40 ms are sufficient for an interferometer experiment. For
an initial state with
N
s
6= 0, the validity regime of the
undepleted pump approximation tends to be somewhat
more restricted.

Sincef
PFS
reduces to 1 for the vacuum state|0,
N
0
,0i,
the phase sensitivity for the vacuum state is given by
∆θ
ep,VS
. In this case, ∆θ
ep,VS
can be interpreted as a
phase sensitivity; for other initial pure Fock states, in
contrast, ∆θ
ep,VS
is not by itself a phase sensitivity but
a function that, together withf
PFS
, determines the phase
sensitivity ∆θ
ep,PFS
. Since ∆θ
ep,VS
is determined by the
“actual device” or interferometer parameters (i.e., it is in-
dependent of the initial state) andf
PFS
is determined by
the initial state (i.e., it is independent of the interferome-
ter parameters), the minimum of ∆θ
ep,PFS
is determined
by independently minimizing ∆θ
ep,VS
andf
PFS
. In what
follows, we first analyzef
PFS
and then ∆θ
ep,VS
.
Sincef
PFS
reduces to 1 in the absence of initial seeding,

tions (47) and (53), which apply to arbitrary initial pure
Fock states (assuming the undepleted pump approxima-
tion is applicable), show:
•Initial seeding decreases the absolute phase sensi-
tivity and hence improves the absolute interfero-
meter performance.
•For a fixed finite
N

and fixed interferometer pa-
rameters, initial single-sided seeding leads to the
best interferometer performance (smallestf

and initial balanced double-sided seeding to the
worst interferometer performance (largestf

due to the presence of the “pair term”

anced double-sided seeding improves the interfer-

In this case, the minimum of the error propagation

Fig. 4), which lies below the standard quantum limit and
below the Heisenberg limit (horizontal green dashed and
dotted lines in Fig. 4). This implies that the Heisenberg
limit does, in this case, not provide a stringent lower
bound. The quantum Cramer-Rao bound is also reached

.  Thus, in
this parameter regime (which includes a variety of non-

without seeding or with single-sided seeding does reach
the quantum Cramer-Rao bound while a pure Fock state
with double-sided seeding does not reach the quantum
Cramer-Rao bound.
B.  Coherent spin state
Let the initial state be a coherent spin state (CSS) [20].
Generally speaking, coherent spin states with single- and
double-sided seeding are much easier to prepare experi-
mentally than pure Fock states with seeding. Coherent
spin states may be characterized as the most classical of
all quantum states [36]. Thus, intuitively one might ex-
pect that coherent spin states perform less well than pure
Fock states for the same interferometer parameters dur-
ing steps 1. and 3. of the interferometer sequence. This
section shows that coherent spin states with double-sided
seeding yield, in some cases, a smaller error propagation
based phase sensitivity than pure Fock states.

proximation are derived for the coherent spin state

of the state given in Eq. (57) is well-defined in the case of
double-sided seeding but not in the case of single-sided
seeding or without seeding; the latter is equal to the vac-
uum state.  In the case of initial double-sided seeding,
the interferometer performance depends on the relative
phase, thereby providing another tuning knob.

The next two sections separately discuss the interfer-
ometer performance within the undepleted pump approx-
imation for coherent spin states with single- and double-
sided seeding. We have checked that our analytical re-
sults presented in the next two sections agree, up to terms
of order 1/N, with the numerical results for the full spin
Hamiltonian
ˆ
H
spin
. To make the comparisons, we used
an initial coherent spin state with fixed particle number
[Eq. (C1)] in our exact diagonalization.
1.  Coherent spin state with single-sided seeding
For an initial coherent spin state with single-sided seed-
ing,N
s
(t) is, for the same interferometer parameters,
identical to that for a pure Fock state with single-sided
seeding [compare Eq. (59) with Eq. (43)].  The quan-
tum fluctuation ∆N
s
(t) for the coherent spin state with
single-sided seeding, in contrast, differs from that for a
pure Fock state with single-sided seeding sinceIis, in
general, non-zero [compare Eq. (60) with Eq. (44)]. Cor-
respondingly, the phase sensitivity for the coherent spin
state with single-sided seeding also differs from that for
the pure Fock state with single-sided seeding. We find
∆θ
ep,CSS,S
= ∆θ
ep,VS

CSS,S
,(61)
where
f
CSS,S
=
q

)N

s
.(62)
For
N
s
= 0, Eq. (61) reduces to ∆θ
ep,VS
; this is in agree-
ment with the fact that the coherent spin state without
seeding reduces to the vacuum state. The factorf
CSS,S
depends on the initial state through
N
s
and the actual
device throughI. TheI
2
term in round brackets under
the square root in Eq. (62) leads, for the same interfer-
ometer parameters, to a degradation of the best inter-
ferometer performance for an initial coherent spin state
with single-sided seeding compared to that of a pure Fock
state with single-sided seeding [compare Eq. (62) with
Eq. (47)]. Importantly, the factorf
CSS,S
can take values
smaller than 1. This implies that a coherent spin state
with single-sided seeding can—for the same interferom-
eter parameters—perform better than an initial vacuum
state.
Since ∆θ
ep,VS
andf
CSS,S
both depend explicitly onθ,
determining the best interferometer performance requires
that one minimizes the product ∆θ
ep,VS
f
CSS,S
, i.e., the
two terms cannot be treated separately. This differs from
the pure Fock state case considered in Sec. IV A, where
∆θ
ep,VS
andf
PFS
could be minimized separately. While
the minimization of ∆θ
ep,VS
f
CSS,S
can, in principle, be
done analytically, the resulting expression for the min-
imum of the error propagation based phase sensitivity
is rather lengthy and not overly illuminating. The fol-
lowing examples illustrate selected characteristics of the
interferometer performance for coherent spin states with
single-sided seeding.

the phase sensitivity obtained for the full spin Hamilto-
nian deviates from the results obtained within the unde-
pleted pump approximation, underscoring the fact that
the long-time dynamics is not described faithfully by the
undepleted pump approximation.
Interestingly, the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for the
three states considered in Fig. 6(a) all lie above the
Heisenberg limit (horizontal green dotted line). This im-
plies that the Heisenberg limit lies, in this case, below the
fundamental bound, i.e., the Heisenberg limit can never
be reached.
2.  Coherent spin state with double-sided seeding
This section considers the interferometer performance
for an initial coherent spin state with double-sided seed-
ing.  Compared to the coherent spin state with single-
sided seeding, the relative phase
θand the distribution
of the atoms among the two probe modes (i.e., the prod-
uct
N
+
N
−
) provide additional tuning knobs.
For an initial coherent spin state with double-sided
seeding, the error propagation based phase sensitivity can
be written as
∆θ

) and the sin-
and cos-terms, in contrast, can take positive or negative

To illustrate the interplay of the different terms that
enter into ∆θ
ep,CSS,D
, we consider the resonant asymmet-
ric interferometer withχ
1

=ξ
1

The dashed, dash-dotted, and solid lines in Fig. 7(a) show
the quantities ∆θ

θ
(γ

B
−γ
 ̃
A
) as a func-
tion ofθ. These quantities are fully determined by the
interferometer parameters, i.e., they are independent of
the initial state. As already discussed in the context of
Fig. 5, ∆θ
ep,VS
exhibits minima forθjust a bit larger
and just a bit smaller thanπ. For these angles,Iand
∂
θ
(γ
 ̃
B
−γ
 ̃
A
) take “intermediate” values (not maxima and
not minima). Since ∆θ
ep,CSS,D
is directly proportional
to ∆θ
ep,VS
and since ∆θ
ep,VS
also enters through the de-
nominator off
CSS,D
, ∆θ
ep,CSS,D
possesses a non-trivial
dependence onθ.
Choosing the balanced case with
N
+
/N
−
= 1 as an ex-
ample, Fig. 7(b) showsf
CSS,D
as a function of the phase
shifter angleθfor various initial phases
θof the coherent
spin state. It can be seen thatf
CSS,D
depends strongly
onθand
θ:f
CSS,D
changes by roughly four orders of
magnitude for
θ= 0.36πandθ= 0 and by less than an
order of magnitude for
θ=π/2. For the example shown,
f
CSS,D
takes a minimum atθ=π(for all
θconsidered)
and a local minimum atθ= 0 and 2π(for all
θconsid-
ered except forθ=π/2). These are exactly the angles
at which ∆θ
ep,VS
diverges. Figure 7(c) shows the error
propagation based phase sensitivity ∆θ
ep,CSS,D
for the
same initial phases
θas considered in Fig. 7(b). It can
be seen that the minimum of ∆θ
ep,CSS,D
is obtained for
θclose to but not equal toπ.
Repeating the analysis for other
N

/N
−
, Fig. 8 shows
the minimum min(∆θ
ep,CSS,D
) of the phase sensitivity as
functions of
θandN
+
/N

for the same interferometer
parameters as considered in Fig. 7.  ForN
+
/N
−
= 0,
min(∆θ
ep,CSS,D
) is independent of
θand equal to 0.2120;
this value agrees, as it should, with the minimum of the
error propagation based phase sensitivity for the coherent
spin state with single-sided seeding (see the dash-dotted
line in Fig. 6 forξ
3
= 3/2).  Figure 8 shows that the
minimum min(∆θ
ep,CSS,D
) of the error propagation based
phase sensitivity can, depending on the values of
N
+
/N
−
and
θ, be larger or smaller than min(∆θ
ep,CSS,S
).
It is interesting to compare the performance of the ini-

14
tial coherent spin state with double-sided seeding with
that for the initial pure Fock state with single-sided seed-
ing (and the same
N
s
); recall, among the pure Fock
states, the pure Fock state with single-sided seeding
yields the smallest phase sensitivity ∆θ
ep
for fixed in-
terferometer parameters. For the interferometer param-
eters considered in Fig. 8, the smallest phase sensitivity
for the pure Fock state is equal to 0.1592. Thus, the min-
imum of the phase sensitivity for the initial coherent spin
state with double-sided seeding is, for a range of
θand
N
+
/N
−
, smaller than that for the pure Fock state with
single-sided seeding. This result is very encouraging as it
points toward the possibility of achieving comparable or
even better phase or parameter estimates for initial co-
herent spin states with double-sided seeding, which are
experimentally fairly straightforward to prepare, than for
initial pure Fock states with single-sided seeding, which
are experimentally rather challenging to prepare.
The solid line in Fig. 9 shows the minimum of the error

ent spin state with

eter withχ

analysis, the minimum of the phase sensitivity is obtained
by minimizing ∆θ

as well as the angleθ. For comparison, the dashed line
shows the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, calculated for
eachξ
3
using the
θandN
+
N
−
values that yield the
smallest ∆θ
ep,CSS,D
. It can be seen that the error propa-
gation based phase sensitivity is closest to the quantum
Cramer-Rao bound for the largestξ
3
considered, i.e., for
ξ
3
= 2.  By analyzing the dynamics for the full spin
Hamiltonian for a
23
Na BEC withN= 10000, we checked
that the undepleted pump approximation provides an ac-
curate description for allξ
3
values considered in Fig. 9. It
is also instructive to compare with the quantum Cramer-
Rao bounds for the double-sided and single-sided pure
Fock states, which are equal to 0.1233 and 0.1592, re-
spectively, forξ
3
≥1. We find that the error propaga-
tion based phase sensitivity for the coherent spin state
is lower than the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for the
pure Fock state for the same interferometer parameters
forξ
3
>1.280 andξ
3
>1.054, respectively. This is in-
teresting, since it indicates that the performance of the
SU(1,1) interferometer, as quantified by the error propa-
gation based phase sensitivity, can “beat” the quantum
Cramer-Rao bound for the pure Fock state, assuming the
same initial seeding
N
s
and the same interferometer pa-
rameters.
V.  CONCLUSIONS
This work analyzed the performance of a spin-1 Bose-
Einstein condensate based interferometer for parame-
ter combinations that can be realized experimentally.
Within the undepleted pump approximation, which is
employed throughout this paper, the spinor BEC realizes
an SU(1,1) interferometer, in which them= 0 state of
thef= 1 hyperfine manifold serves as the pump and the
m= +1 andm=−1 hyperfine states serve as the probe.
Although the interferometer itself, which consists of the
state preparation, phase imprinting, and read-out steps,
has eight experimentally tunable parameters (t
1
,q
1
,c
1
,
t
2
,q
ps
,t
3
,q
3
,c
3
), it is characterized by five parameters
within the undepleted pump approximation: two that de-
scribe the state preparation step, one that describes the
phase imprinting step, and two that describe the read-
out step.  The initial state adds additional degrees of
freedom: For pure Fock states the fraction of atoms in
the three different hyperfine states can be varied. For co-
herent spin states with double-sided seeding, the initial
relative phase provides an additional tuning knob. The
validity regime of the undepleted pump approximation
limited our analysis to cases where the side mode popu-
lation of the initial state and the time propagated state
are much smaller than the population of the pump mode.
The dependence of the performance of the spinor-BEC
based SU(1,1) interferometer on the seeding fraction and
initial phase of coherent spin states was already investi-
gated in Ref. [35] within the truncated Wigner approx-
imation. As in our work, both phase insensitive ampli-
fiers (single-sided seeding) and phase sensitive amplifiers
(double-sided seeding) were considered. Our analytical
results, obtained within the undepleted pump approxi-
mation, confirm the results of Ref. [35] with regards to
the role played by the initial state:  (ai) Even a tiny
seeding fraction has a non-negligible effect on the in-
terferometer performance; correspondingly, an analysis
of experimental interferometer results needs to account
for possible imperfections of the initial state. (aii) The
best interferometer performance min(∆θ
ep
) of a coher-
ent spin state with single-sided seeding is obtained for
a phase shifter angle that differs (typically just slightly)
from that of the vacuum state; in fact, the angle at which
the vacuum state performs best yields the worst per-
formance for the coherent spin state with single-sided
seeding. For the same interferometer parameters, an ini-
tial coherent spin state with single-sided seeding yields a
lower min(∆θ
ep
) than an initial vacuum state. (aiii) The
coherent spin state with double-sided seeding can per-
form better than the vacuum state and pure Fock states
with single- and double-sided seeding for appropriately
chosen initial phases. This is a very encouraging result
from the experimental point of view since coherent spin
states with double-sided seeding can be realized fairly
straightforwardly by first preparing a condensate in the
|f= 1,m= 0istate and by then applying a short radio-
frequency pulse that transfers a fraction of the atoms into
them=±1 states. The initial phases of the three hyper-
fine components can be controlled by introducing a finite
variable detuning. Alternatively, microwave transitions
that couple to thef= 2 manifold can be used [24, 26, 27].
Additional findings of our work are: (bi) Within the
undepleted pump approximation, analytical expressions
that account for all three steps of the SU(1,1) interferom-
eter sequence were presented for an arbitrary pure initial

15
state and analyzed for a subset of Fock and coherent spin
states. We expect that these expressions, which can be
straightforwardly implemented in Mathematica or other
software packages, will aid the analysis of experimen-
tal results and serve as a benchmark for solutions that
go beyond the undepleted pump approximation.  (bii)
Pure Fock states with single-sided seeding perform, as-
suming the same interferometer parameters, better than
pure Fock states with double-sided seeding. Pure Fock
states with double-sided seeding, in turn, perform better
than the vacuum state. From a practical point of view,
pure Fock states with non-zero seeding are rather fragile
and hence challenging to work with experimentally. (biii)
Parameter regimes where coherent spin states perform
better than pure Fock states with single-sided seeding,
in addition to performing better than the vacuum state
[see point (aiii) above], were identified (again, assuming
the same interferometer parameters). This is encourag-
ing since this finding underscores that the spin mixing
dynamics can generate, starting from an initial coher-
ent state that may be viewed as the most classical of all
quantum states, useful “quantum-ness” or entanglement
during the first stage of the interferometer sequence.
Last, we highlight a number of key findings that relate
to the interferometer steps themselves. (ci) For a coher-
ent spin state with single- or double-sided seeding, the
error propagation based sensitivity continues, for a wide
range of parameters, to decrease forξ
3
> ξ
1
, i.e., when
t
3
> t
1
. This asymmetric behavior might be enhanced if
one goes beyond the undepleted pump approximation.
(cii) The quantum Cramer-Rao bound, which is fully
determined by the state|Ψ(t
1
)ithat enters the linear
phase imprinting step of the interferometer, provides the
ultimate lower bound for the phase sensitivity; unfortu-
nately, however, no general protocols for its direct experi-
mental determination exist. The error propagation based
phase sensitivity ∆θ
ep
, in contrast, depends on all three
stages of the interferometer.  Our calculations suggest
that it is, in general, not possible to predict min(∆θ
ep
) by
simply maximizingN
s
(t
1
) or ∆N
s
(t
1
). While this is not
unexpected, it highlights the interconnectedness of the
various parameters. (ciii) The Heisenberg limit [taken to
be given by 1/N
s
(t
1
)] lies, for certain parameter combi-
nations, below the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, indicat-
ing that one should, in general, work with the quantum
Cramer-Rao bound and not with the Heisenberg limit.
Since the observed behavior was verified by performing
calculations for the full spin Hamiltonian, this conclusion
is not an artifact of the undepleted pump approximation
but valid more generally.

shown in Figs. 2, 3, and

undepleted pump approximation employ dimensionless
parameters. This implies that the undepleted pump ap-
proximation results shown in Figs. 3-9 are applicable to a
wide range of atomic species. The main limitation is that
the sign ofξ

many cases—not be tuned. For example,c

Appendix B: Properties of Eqs. (28)-(31)
Equations (28)-(31) imply the following:
1. The parameterξ

andξ

are real and their sign is
determined by the sign of the coupling strengthsc
1
andc
3
, respectively.
2. The parametersχ

are either purely real or
purely imaginary.

Appendix C: Coherent spin state
This appendix derives the expression for the coherent
spin state, Eq. (57), used in Sec. IV B within the unde-
pleted pump approximation. The derivation starts with

state yields, when employed as an initial state for the time propogation under the full spin Hamiltonian

spin
, results
that agree up to order 1/Nwith the UPA results presented in Secs. IV B 1 and IV B 2. For example, this state is used
to obtain the circles in Fig. 6(b). When using Eq. (C1), we define
θ=−(θ

+θ
−1
), i.e., we setθ
0
to zero. This
does not pose any restrictions on our formulation since the resultsare independent of the overall phase factor of the
initial state.

Importantly, the right hand side of Eq. (C1) is, in the largeNlimit, identical to Eq. (C5), i.e., Eq. (C5) is the coherent

In the spirit of the undepleted pump approximation, we now replace the operator ˆa
†
0
in Eq. (C5) by (

)
1/2
. This
replacement has the following consequences: (i) The term exp


goes to 1. (ii) No atoms are created in
them= 0 hyperfine state, i.e., them= 0 mode of the three-mode state is effectively being eliminated. (iii) Expanding
out the exponential that contains the operators ˆa
†
+1
and ˆa
†
−1
, it can be seen that the state is a superposition of Fock
states containing varying number of atoms; this observation is closely related to point (ii) and also implies that
Nshould now be interpreted as a parameter as opposed to the actual atom number. (iv) The state is no longer
normalized to 1. Restoring the normalization and usingβ

exp(ıθ

Except for the overall phase exp(ıNθ
0
), which does not
have an effect on any of the observables, this is the co-
herent spin state, Eq. (57), used in our undepleted pump
approximation calculations in Sec. IV B. We emphasize
that even though them= 0 mode has been effectively
eliminated from the formulation, this mode still serves as
a phase reference. This can be seen from the fact that
θ

We develop a microscopic model to describe the Josephson dynamics between two superfluid reser-
voirs of ultracold fermionic atoms which accounts for the dependence of the critical current on both
the barrier height and the interaction strength along the crossover from BCS to BEC. Building on
a previous study [F. Meier & W. Zwerger, Phys.  Rev.  A,64033610 (2001)] of weakly-interacting
bosons, we derive analytic results for the Josephson critical current at zero temperature for homo-
geneous and trapped systems at arbitrary coupling.  The critical current exhibits a maximum near
the  unitarity  limit  which  arises  from  the  competition  between  the  increasing  condensate  fraction
and a decrease of the chemical potential along the evolution from the BCS to the BEC limit.  Our
results agree quantitatively with numerical simulations and recent experimental data.
I.  INTRODUCTION
Josephson  weak  links  [1,  2]  represent  a  paradigmatic
tool to investigate phase coherence between coupled su-
perfluids [3, 4], and they have been realized in a variety
of different setups:  From solid state systems [5],  where
the  Josephson  effect  has  played  a  crucial  role,  e.g.   to
unveil thed-wave nature of pairing in high temperature
superconductors  [6,  7],  to  neutral  superfluids  of  liquid
Helium  [8,  9]  and  weakly  interacting  Bose  condensates
of ultracold atoms [10–21].  More recently, both theoret-
ical  [22–26]  and  experimental  [27–30]  efforts  have  been
targeted  to  investigate  the  Josephson  dynamics  in  the
context  of  ultracold  superfluids  of  strongly  interacting
fermion pairs.  The so-called BCS-BEC crossover [31, 32]
which relies on exploiting Feshbach resonances between
two different hyperfine states of ultracold fermions [33],
offers the unique possibility to investigate, within a single
physical system, Josephson tunneling from the standard
BCS limit of weakly bound fermion pairs to a Bose Ein-
stein  condensate  of  tightly  bound  molecules,  including
the scale invariant unitary Fermi gas at infinite scatter-
ing length as an intermediate phase.
In contrast with their bosonic counterparts, crossover
superfluids are a challenging system to explore.  On the
experimental side, the strong interactions require, for co-
herent Josephson dynamics to be unveiled, the imprinting
of thin barrier potentials on the sample, with thicknesses
on the order of very few interparticle spacings [29, 30].
On the theoretical side, the crossover regime poses a diffi-
cult many-body problem for which many observables are
accessible only by approximate methods [32].  In partic-
ular, microscopic calculations of the Josephson currents
based on the solution of Bogoliubov de Gennes equations
(BdGE)  have  been  reported  in  Refs.   [22,  25,  26].   Al-
though  they  provide  a  qualitatively  correct  description
of the entire crossover region, the approach is quantita-
tively reliable only in the BCS limit. An alternative strat-
egy  relies  on  the  zero-temperature  extended  Thomas-
Fermi  models  (ETFM)  [23,  24,  26].   These  approaches
are based on a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation for
the complex order parameterψ(r) of bosonic pairs with
massM=  2mwhich  tunnel  across  a  barrier  of  effec-
tive heightV

with  the  mean  field  BdGE  approach,  is  thatμ(n,a)  is
an independent, purely thermodynamic input parameter
for the calculation of the Josephson current.  Hence, the
correct chemical potential throughout the crossover can
be accounted for by including the corresponding results
obtained from independent Quantum Monte-Carlo calcu-
lations, see e.g.  Ref.  [34].  Nonetheless, it turns out that
the EFTM method can properly describe the Josephson
effect only in the BEC limit but it fails, even qualitatively,
in the unitary and BCS regimes [26, 29]. In particular, for
fixed barrier heights, ETFM calculations yield a mono-
tonically increasing Josephson current when moving from
the BEC to the BCS limit.  By contrast, the critical cur-
rent is found to reach a maximum value near unitarity
both  experimentally  [29,  30]  and  also  in  the  numerical
BdGE  calculations  [22,  25,  26].   Therefore,  developing
a unified model which provides a quantitatively correct
description of the Josephson effect throughout the BCS-
BEC crossover represents a relevant and timely problem,
which is addressed in the present study.
Our work builds upon a previous microscopic descrip-
tion of the Josephson dynamics between two weakly in-
teracting Bose Einstein condensates by one of us [12]. We
will show that a straightforward extension of this model
to  fermionic  superfluids  quantitatively  reproduces  both
the results of numerical simulations and also the exper-
imental data over a wide range of parameters.  Surpris-
ingly,  this  holds  even  beyond  the  weak  tunneling  limit
considered  in  the  underlying  microscopic  model.   Our

study suggests that, throughout the BCS-BEC crossover,
the critical Josephson current can be evaluated analyti-
cally solely on the basis of (i) the single-particle trans-
mission amplitude for a pair at the relevant chemical po-
tential, and (ii) bulk properties of the superfluid at equi-
librium, specifically, the condensate density and the pair
chemical potential.  Most importantly, our approach pro-
vides  a  straightforward  explanation  for  the  experimen-
tally  observed  maximum  of  the  critical  current  density
near unitarity which arises from two competing effects:
the increase of the condensate fraction and the concur-
rent decrease of the chemical potential as a function of
the dimensionless coupling strength 1/k
F
a.  The identifi-
cation of the unitary gas as the most stable fermionic su-
perfluid [22, 35–38] thus appears from a viewpoint which
applies  uniformly  over  the  whole  regime  from  weak  to
strong coupling, with no need to invoke different dissipa-
tion mechanisms, such as pair breaking on the BCS and
phonon-like excitations on the BEC side [22, 26, 35].
II.  JOSEPHSON CURRENT FROM BCS TO
BEC
In  the  following,  we  will  argue  that  the  results  ob-
tained in Ref.  [12] for the Josephson current between two
weakly interacting BEC’s can be extended in a straight-
forward manner to fermionic superfluids.  This will pro-
vide an analytical result which holds throughout the full
crossover from BCS to BEC. We start by considering a
generic setup of a Josephson junction with the geometry
depicted in Fig. 1a, where a rectangular barrier connects
two  homogeneous  reservoirs.   The  results  obtained  for
this idealized case will then be generalized to the harmon-
ically trapped situation and Gaussian barriers sketched in
Fig. 1b, relevant to compare our model predictions with
experimental data [29, 30].
For barrier heightsV
0
which considerably exceed the
boson chemical potentialμ
B
, it has been shown in Ref.
[12] that the Josephson currents can be evaluated analyt-
ically in a systematic expansion in powers of an effective
transfer Hamiltonian
ˆ
H
T
.  In leading order, this gives rise
to a non-dissipative Josephson current between the two
superfluid reservoirs with a sinusoidal current-phase rela-
tionI(φ) =I
c
sinφ, whereφis the difference between the
condensate phases across the junction [39].  Assuming a
homogeneous situation with transverse areaA=L

Formally, Eq.  (1) also contains the total longitudinal size
2Bof the system which however drops out, as expected.
Indeed, for the junction geometry of Fig. 1a, the matrix

which shows that inter-particle interactions affectj

only
through  bulk  properties  of  the  superfluid.   Specifically,
they involve the chemical potentialμ
B
and the conden-
sate densityn
c
which, to lowest order in the interactions
between the pairs, coincides with the full Bose density.  It
is important to notice that the microscopic tunneling am-
plitude|t|(μ
B
) is the one for asingleboson.  It depends
on the interaction strength only to the extent that this

3
determines  the  relevant  energy  at  which  the  tunneling
process occurs.  As discussed in Ref.  [12], the separation
between single particle and many-body properties within
Eq.  (3) originates from the underlying assumption that
the barrier heightV
0
greatly exceeds the chemical poten-
tialμ
B
.  Under these conditions, our major claim in the
following is that Eq.  (3) correctly describes the Joseph-
son current atanycoupling strength.
The fact that Eq.  (3) may hold even for fermionic su-
perfluids throughout the crossover from the BCS to the
BEC limit is supported by the quite remarkable observa-
tion that,  upon a proper identification of the variables,
this result essentially coincides with the well known ex-
pression for the critical current between two BCS super-
conductors.  Within BCS theory,  the critical current of
a Josephson junction in the tunneling limit is known to
be equal to the current flowing in the normal state at a
finite applied voltageeV=π∆
0
/2, where ∆
0
is the en-
ergy gap at zero temperature[1, 3, 40].  By evaluating the
normal state conductance per unit area, which scales lin-
early with the number of discrete transverse modes, the
Ambegaokar-Baratoff (AB) formula for thepaircurrent
density between two BCS superfluids coupled by a thin
tunneling barrier can be expressed in the form [25]

alent.  Indeed, in the BCS limit, the condensate density

More specifically, it is instructive to consider the ther-
modynamic prefactor, common to the BCS result Eq.  (6)
and the BEC one Eq.  (3) for the critical current density,
for  a  fermionic  superfluid  at  arbitrary  coupling.   This
quantity, which encodes the many-body properties of the
system, can be suitably expressed in terms of the conden-

The  dependence  of  these  two  thermodynamic  quanti-
ties on the coupling strength is shown in Fig.  2, which
presents the results forλ
0
(green line) and   ̃μ(blue line)
obtained within a Luttinger-Ward approach to the BCS-
BEC crossover problem developed by Haussmannet al.
[43].   Apparently,  these  two  bulk  properties  exhibit  an
opposite behavior as a function of the coupling strength:
while   ̃μmonotonically decreases from one towards zero
upon moving from the BCS to the BEC limit, the conden-
sate  fractionλ
0
monotonically  increases  from  exponen-
tially small values in the BCS regime towards unity for a
weakly interacting Bose superfluid.  A qualitatively sim-
ilar behavior is also obtained within a mean field BdGE
approach, see e.g.  Ref.  [44] and references therein.  How-
ever,  the results of the two theories differ substantially
on a quantitative level.  In particular, for the gas at uni-
tarity,  mean  field  calculations  yield  a  condensate  frac-
tionλ
0
∼0.7 instead of 0.51,  and a chemical potential
 ̃μ∼0.56 instead of the value 0.36 obtained within the
Luttinger-Ward approach,  which agrees quite well with
the experimental value   ̃μ=ξ
s
= 0.37 for the associated
Bertsch  parameter,  see  [45].   As  a  consequence  of  the

4
competing trends ofλ
0
and   ̃μ, the thermodynamic pre-
factor in Eq.  (7) reaches a maximum near unitarity (see
red line in Fig.  2),  in qualitative agreement with both
experimental [29] and numerical [22, 26] findings.  Note,
however, that the origin of the non-monotonic behavior
in the present theory is quite different from the interpre-
tation given by Spuntarelliet al.[22] for the case of weak
barriers.   There,  following  a  Landau  criterion,  the  rise
and fall of the maximum Josephson current was ascribed
to  the  existence  of  two  distinct  types  of  critical  veloc-
ities  associated  with  two  different  excitation  branches:
pair-breaking on the BCS and phonons on the BEC side,
respectively.  By contrast, our result Eq.  (7) shows that
in  the  tunneling  regime  this  peculiar  non-monotonicity
emerges  from  the  competition  betweenλ
0
and   ̃μuni-
formly  throughout  the  crossover  region.    This  conclu-
sion  is  further  supported  by  recent  experimental  stud-
ies [29, 30], which unambiguously identified vortex rings
and phonons, rather than ”fermionic” pair-breaking ex-
citations, as the microscopic mechanisms responsible for
the  breakdown  of  the  dissipationless  flow,  even  on  the
BCS side of the crossover.
In the following, we focus on the difference between the
BEC result in Eq.  (3) and the BCS one of Eq.  (6) that,
as highlighted in Eq.  (7), amounts to the ratio between
the  tunneling  amplitude  of  one  pair  and  the  transmis-
sion probability of one fermion,  evaluated at their rele-
vant energies.  Naively, such a quantity could be expected
to  exhibit  an  exponential  dependence  upon  the  barrier
thicknessdand the normalized heightV
0
/μ
B
, hence caus-
ing a large quantitative mismatch between the BCS and
BEC  results.   However,  employing  the  mapping  of  the
”fermionic” BdGE approach onto the ”bosonic” ETFM
one [26], it can be verified that this is not the case:  The
ratio  of  these  two  transmission  terms  is  of  order  unity
for a wide range of barrier geometries, featuring only a
very  weak  dependence  upon  the  barrier  properties  and
the chemical potential.  Indeed, applying Eq.  (3) to the
BCS limit of the crossover yields a critical current density
that matches the BCS result Eq.  (6) within a few 10%
accuracy.   For  instance,  over  an  extremely  wide  range
k

.2  [29,  30],  the  deviations  are  in  fact
smaller  than  20%.   In  view  of  these  results,  in  the  fol-
lowing we will thus use the extension of the bosonic ex-
pression  Eq.   (3)  to  arbitrary  couplings  to  describe  the
critical current of a Josephson junction along the entire
BCS-BEC crossover.
In order to benchmark our analytic theory against nu-
merical and experimental results, it is necessary to also
take into account higher harmonics that contribute to the
critical current.  In fact, as already mentioned in the pre-
vious section, the tunneling limit of exponentially small
values of|t|(μ
B
) is hard to achieve in practice and realis-
tic barrier heightsV
0
are close to, or only slightly larger
than, the chemical potential [29, 30].  Therefore, higher
order  terms  in  the  expansion  in  powers  of  the  transfer
Hamiltonian are non-negligible.  In particular, in second
order, these lead to an additional non-dissipative contri-
butionI
1
cos 2φto the coherent flow.  It has half of the
periodφ→φ+ 2πof the fundamental Josephson cur-
rent [12] since it is due to the coherent tunneling of two
bosonic pairs.  Using the results of Ref.  [12], the second
harmonic current density is linked to the dominant first
order term via

which still exhibits the separation between single-particle
and many-body properties discussed above for the lead-
ing contribution given by Eq.  (3).
Moreover, in order to test the predictions of our model
against recent experimental data [30] and BEC results of
EFTM numerical simulations [46] available in the litera-
ture, it is necessary to generalize the results obtained in
Eq.  (3) to the experimentally relevant case [29, 30] of in-
homogeneous samples and Gaussian barriers, see Fig. 1b.
In particular,  the result in Eq.  (3) for the (first order)
critical current density can be easily extended to account
for an inhomogeneous condensate density profilen

By following a similar procedure and recalling Eq.  (8),
one can straightforwardly obtain an analytic expression

of a generic junction affects the maximum Josephson cur-

III.  COMPARISON WITH BdGE NUMERICAL
RESULTS FOR THE CROSSOVER REGION
In  the  following,  we  compare  the  predictions  of  our
model  for  a  fixed  barrier  geometry  with  numerical  re-
sults based on the solution of time-dependent mean field
BdGE, reported in Ref.  [26].  To this end,  we consider
the specific setup of Zou and Dalfovo [26], analogous to
the one sketched in Fig.  1a.  In Fig.  3 the dashed line
represents the critical fermion current (2I
Max
) predicted
by our analytic model for the barrier and reservoir pa-
rameters detailed in the figure legend, and employing the
mean field continuum results for chemical potential and
condensate density, respectively (see Ref.  [44] and refer-
ences therein).
As already emphasized in the previous section, we ob-
tain a non-monotonic critical current as the interaction
is changed from the BCS to the BEC regime.  Compared
with the behavior ofλ

which  monotonically  decreases  when  moving  from  the
BCS towards the BEC limit.  In particular, this causes an
overall suppression of the maximum Josephson current,
more pronounced in the strong attraction limit of tightly
bound pairs, where the chemical potential most strongly
varies with the coupling strength.
Notably, our model appears in reasonable quantitative
agreement with the results of BdGE simulations [26], see
red dots in Fig.  3.  In particular, the mismatch between
our  theory  and  the  numerical  results  is  largely  ascrib-

superfluid  properties,  relative  to  the  continuum  ones.
For instance, the agreement significantly improves when
we employ the BdGE chemical potential values obtained
within  the  actual  tightly  confining  box  [48],  systemati-
cally higher than the continuum result, see blue solid line
in Fig.  3.  In this case, our theory matches the numeri-
cal data with deviations not exceeding 30% throughout
the crossover region.  Additionally, the residual mismatch
can be largely attributed to effects not taken into account
when evaluating our model predictions:  First, the small
box size may also cause an increased condensate fraction,
relative to the continuum case, especially on the BCS side
of the crossover.  Second, the determination of the crit-
ical  current  by  solving  the  time  dependent  BdGE  was
obtained by imparting a sizable initial excitation to the
system  [26],  yielding  an  additional  kinetic  energy  con-
tribution to the overall particle energy, neglected in our

6
model.
The  ability  of  our  analytic  theory  to  yield  quantita-
tively accurate Josephson currents in the crossover region
is further demonstrated by the comparison presented in
Fig.  4.  There, we contrast our prediction based on Eq.
(3), for the fermion current density (2~j
c
) of unitary su-
perfluids with the numerical results obtained by Zou and
Dalfovo [26] solving stationary BdGE, both as a function
of the barrier height for a few values of the dimensionless
barrier  thickness  (Fig.   4a),  and  vice-versa  for  different
barrier heights as a function of the thickness (Fig.  4b).
Following the convention of Ref.  [26], the barrier height
is given in the legends for one fermion,V
0f
=V

/2.  Ap-
parently,  our  analytic  predictions  quantitatively  repro-
duce the numerical results remarkably well over a wide
range of barrier geometries. Indeed, as long as the barrier
height exceeds the superfluid chemical potential, sizable
deviations are observed only for the case of anomalously
thin barriers (see black squares in Fig.  4a), for which our
theoretical  model  based  on  Eq.   (3)  would  converge  to
the numerical data only for exceedingly highV
0
values.
On the other hand and not surprisingly, our model fails
even at the qualitative level forV

IV.  COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS
Finally, we compare our model predictions with exper-
imental  data  that  were  obtained  in  the  Lithium  lab  at
LENS [30], and also with ETFM numerical simulations
carried out in the BEC limit [46].  To this end, we evalu-

both first and second order contributions [47], in the case
of harmonically trapped samples and Gaussian barriers
(see Fig.  1b), exploiting Eqs.  (10) and (8), respectively.
For simplicity, the Gaussian barrier is approximated with
an Eckart potential of the form

for which the single-particle transmission probability can
be evaluated analytically,  see e.g.  Ref.  [49].  In partic-
ular, it can be verified that a Gaussian profile withe

function withd∼0.6w.  Inserting the transmission am-
plitude  of  the  Eckart  barrier  both  in  Eq.   (10)  for  the
first  order  current  and  in  the  analogous  expression  for
the second harmonic based on Eq.  (8), and accounting
for  the  relevant  superfluid  atom  number  and  trap  fre-
quencies  employed  by  Burchiantiet al.[30],  we  obtain
our zero-temperature model predictions for the resulting
maximum  currentI

[47].   For  this  comparison,  we
exploited the chemical potential and condensate fraction
obtained within the Luttinger-Ward approach [43].  An
important point to emphasize in this context is that the

inclusion of second order contributions toI

tial,  as  it  yields  corrections  to  the  first  order  term  up
to 15%.  Regarding the crossover and BCS regimes, our
model correctly reproduces the observed trends, at least
within  the  large  uncertainties  of  the  experimental  data
and of the zero-temperature approximation done in the
theoretical analysis.  In particular, we remark that inclu-
sion of the non-perturbative results for both chemical po-
tential and condensate fraction [51] is essential to obtain
quantitative agreement with the data, which would not
match our theory if mean field results were employed.  As
a consequence,  although more  experimental studies are
required to fully validate our model within the crossover
and BCS regimes, we stress that the measure of the criti-
cal Josephson current may provide a valuable experimen-
tal tool to determine the condensate density in crossover
superfluids, a quantity which is hard to access by other
means.
V.  CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
Building  on  a  microscopic  model  for  the  Josephson
current  between  two  weakly  interacting  Bose  Einstein
condensates [12], we have developed a simple theoretical
framework  which  captures  the  corresponding  dynamics
of strongly interacting fermionic superfluids throughout
the BCS-BEC crossover.  As testified by the comparison
with  available  numerical  [26,  46]  and  experimental  [30]
data,  our  model  provides  a  quantitative  description  of
the critical currents in generic junction geometries, solely
based on bulk properties of the superfluid state and the
knowledge  of  the  single  boson  transmission  amplitude.
An important feature of our theory is that it provides a
consistent  explanation  for  the  non-monotonic  trend  for
the  maximum  Josephson  current  observed  near  unitar-
ity.   Its  origin  is  connected  with  the  interplay  between
a decrease of the chemical potential and a concomitant
increase of the condensate fraction if the interactions are
tuned  from  the  BCS  to  the  BEC  limit.   By  contrast,
EFTM  models,  to  which  our  theory  naturally  connects
deep  in  the  BEC  limit,  fail  for  intermediate  and  weak
couplings  even  at  the  qualitative  level  [22,  26]  since  in
these numerical approaches the condensate density coin-
cides by construction with the superfluid one at all cou-
plings.  In the future, therefore, it will be interesting to
test whether a modified EFTM formalism which explic-
itly accounts for the reduction of the condensate fraction
upon going from the BEC towards the unitary gas and
eventually  the  BCS  limit  yields  results  consistent  with
the ones obtained here or through BdGE approaches. We
also anticipate that our model could be extended to de-
scribe dissipative normal currents [30], and to account for
finite  temperature  effects.   Moreover,  starting  from  the
present study, it might be possible to investigate how the
critical  current  evolves  from  the  tunneling  regime  con-
sidered here to the case of weak barriers studied in Refs.
[22, 25, 36].
On a rather fundamental level, it remains an open chal-
lenge to justify our use of the result in Eq.  (3),  which
is based on viewing the Josephson effect throughout the
BCS-BEC crossover in terms of the coherent tunneling of
pairs, by developing a truly microscopic approach which
involves the constituent fermions.  Within such a descrip-
tion  and  in  the  tunneling  limit,  the  Josephson  effect  is
second order in the single fermion tunneling amplitudes

Suppressing nonadiabatic transitions during adiabatic generation of highly entangled
states in bosonic Josephson junctions
Takuya Hatomura
NTT Basic Research Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kanagawa 243-0198, Japan
(Dated:  July 17, 2019)
We study suppression of nonadiabatic transitions during adiabatic generation of a cat state and
a spin squeezed state in a bosonic Josephson junction.  In order to minimize the adiabatic error, we
use quantum adiabatic brachistochrone, which enables us totrack a geometrically efficient path in
parameter space under given conditions without requiring additional terms.  For creation of a cat
state, divergence of the quantum geometric tensor associated with gap closing at the critical point is
avoided because of the parity conservation.  The resulting schedules of parameters are smooth and
monotonically decreasing curves.  Use of these schedules offers reduction of time to generate both of
a cat state and a spin squeezed state.
I.  INTRODUCTION
Development of quantum science and technologies has
elucidated usefulness of entanglement.  In many fields,
use of entangled states enables us to outperform classical
devices [
1]. For example, in quantum metrology, we can
produce sensors that estimate unknown parameters with
higher resolution than the classical limitation called the
standard quantum limit [
2–4].  Moreover, macroscopic
entanglement provides us with significant resolution ap-
proaching the quantum limitation known as the Heisen-
berg limit [
2–4]. Unknown parameters that we can esti-
mate differ depending on physical systems, and thus gen-
eration of highly entangled states has been investigated
in various systems. In atomic systems, a lot of successful
experiments generating spin squeezed states have been
reported [
5–9]. The number of particles composing these
spin squeezed states is suitable to be said macroscopic
(see, e.g., Ref. [
4]). Moreover, cat states have been also
produced in trapped ions [
10–12]. However, in contrast
to spin squeezed states, the number of particles compos-
ing cat states is still limited to a dozen.
Typically, these highly entangled states can be dynam-
ically generated by using the one-axis twisting interac-
tion [
13]. Indeed, the one-axis twisting interaction leads a
coherent spin state into a spin squeezed state at first [
13]
and into a cat state later [
14]. However, generation time
of a cat state is not so short, and thus it is difficult to cre-
ate a large cat state within coherence time. Faster gen-
eration can be realized by just adding the Rabi coupling
to the one-axis twisting interaction [
15], while fidelity to
a cat state decreases when system size becomes large.
Not only generation time and size of entanglement, but
also to stop creation at final time is also difficult. Be-
cause these generation schemes are based on dynamical
interference driven by nonlinear interactions, we have to
turn off all interactions at final time. Otherwise, highly
entangled states collapse into useless states.
These highly entangled state can be also generated by
adiabatic driving.  Indeed, with certain parameter val-
ues, the ground state of a system consisting of the one-
axis twisting interaction and the Rabi coupling is a spin
squeezed state for repulsive interaction [
16] and that is
a cat state for attractive interaction [17]. Note that it is
difficult to directly approach these ground states by just
cooling down because of small energy gaps. In adiabatic
generation, we first prepare the trivial ground state in
the large Rabi coupling limit, and then we adiabatically
sweep parameters into the large one-axis twisting inter-
action limit [
17–21].  Notably generation time of a cat
state is comparable to typical coherence time [
21]. How-
ever, large cat states have not been realized yet. This
limitation mainly arises from particle losses [
22]. Parti-
cle losses induce various noises during generation and de-
stroy entanglement. Because particle losses are inevitable
in ultracold atom experiments, speedup of generation is
rather of interest to reduce bad influence.
In both of dynamical and adiabatic generation of spin
squeezed states, application of optimal control theory
and shortcuts to adiabaticity has been discussed and
speedup of generation was found [
23–27]. However, op-
timal control theory usually requires fast and irregular
oscillating schedules of parameters [
23,26], which in-
duce nonadiabatic transitions and interference to finally
achieve high fidelity to a target state, and thus experi-
mental implementation is not so straightforward. Short-
cuts to adiabaticity also requires oscillating schedules of
parameters, whereas oscillation of these schedules is rel-
atively slow [
24,25,27]. For creation of cat states, appli-
cation of optimal control theory and shortcuts to adia-
baticity was also considered [
28,29]. In the former case,
fast and irregular oscillating schedules and turning off all
interactions at last are required to accelerate dynamical
generation [
28]. In latter case, the two-axis countertwist-
ing interaction [
13] is additionally required to speedup
adiabatic generation [29]. However, in spite of the fact
that usefulness of the two-axis countertwisting interac-
tion for fast generation of macroscopic entanglement was
pointed out about a quarter century ago [
13] and a lot
of methods for realization were proposed [
30–34], there is
no experimental realization of it in atomic systems yet.
Therefore, other realistic routes to fast generation should
be investigated.
Quantum adiabatic brachistochrone is a systematic

2
method to find a time-optimal schedule of parameters
in a system [
35,36].  There, a cost function of the
adiabatic condition is viewed as the action and mini-
mized according to the variational principle. The result-
ing Euler-Lagrange equation gives the geodesic equation
for adiabaticity and provides a schedule of parameters.
Compared with counterdiabatic driving [
37,38], which
is one of the methods in shortcuts to adiabaticity [
39],
quantum adiabatic brachistochrone does not require ad-
ditional terms, and thus it is rather implementable.
In this paper, we use quantum adiabatic brachis-
tochrone to suppress nonadiabatic transitions during adi-
abatic generation of a cat state and a spin squeezed state
in a bosonic Josephson junction without requiring addi-
tional terms. We show that both optimized schedules for
adiabatic generation of a cat state and a spin squeezed
state are smooth and monotonically decreasing curves.
Here, for creation of a cat state, we use the parity con-
servation of a bosonic Josephson junction to avoid diver-
gence of the quantum geometric tensor.  According to
these schedules, we observe increase of quantum Fisher
information for a generated cat state and decrease of the
spin squeezing parameter for a generated spin squeezed
state, which represent improvement of adiabaticity and
increase of metrological usefulness.
This paper is constructed as follows. In Sec.
II, we re-
view properties of bosonic Josephson junctions and for-
malism of quantum adiabatic brachistochrone.  Gener-
ation schemes are explained in Sec.
III Ain detail. We
first discuss generation of cat states in Sec.
III Band later
discuss generation of spin squeezed states in Sec.

We summarize the present article in Sec.

cluding the low-energy limit of Bose-Einstein conden-
sates [

The first term is also known as the one-axis twisting in-
teraction [
13]. This system is characterized by the pa-
rameter
Λ =
χN
Ω
,(3)
whereNis the number of atoms. Here we assume Ω≤0.
For positive nonlinearityχ >0, the ground state of
the Hamiltonian (
1) becomes a spin squeezed state when
the parameter Λ
−1
is small,|Λ
−1
|<1 [16]. This type
of spin squeezed states has been realized in experiments
by adiabatically splitting condensates [
5].  The level of
squeezing depends on competition between adiabaticity
and losses, i.e., how slowly changing parameters to sup-
press nonadiabatic transitions and how quickly generat-
ing a spin squeezed state to suppress bad influence of
particle losses [
8]. Therefore, speedup of generation is of
interest.
In contrast, for negative nonlinearityχ <0, a cat state
can be realized as the ground state of the Hamiltonian
(1) for 0≤Λ
−1
<1 [17].  However, creation of this
cat state would be failed if one just cools the system in
this parameter region due to occurrence of spontaneous
symmetry breaking. This happens because of the expo-
nentially small energy gap between the ground state and
the first excited state.  Adiabatic generation is one of
the strategies to create this cat state [
17,20,21]. The
key point of adiabatic generation is the parity conserva-
tion [
21] ensured by the commutation relation
[H
BJJ
,Π] = 0,(4)
where Π is the parity operator
Π = exp[iπ(J−J
x
)].(5)
In adiabatic generation, we first start with the trivial
ground state of the Hamiltonian (
1) in the disordered
phase Λ
−1
>1 that has the parity Π = +1. Because the
first excited state has the parity Π =−1 and the parity
is conserved in time evolution, we can ignore the expo-
nentially small energy gap [
21]. The parity conservation
also ensures that the generated state is rather a superpo-
sition of different size cat states [
41]. It was shown that
the parity measurement and the Fourier analysis enable
us to detect this superposition including the information
of the size distribution of these cat states and also to
maximally extract the potential of this superposition in
interferometry [
41]. However, these properties are lost in
an exponential way under particle losses although its de-
cay rate is smaller than that of dynamical generation [
41],
and thus we are interested in acceleration of generation.
B.  Quantum adiabatic brachistochrone
Quantum adiabatic brachistochrone provides us with
systematic temporal optimization of Hamiltonians to
achieve adiabatic time evolution [
35,36]. Here we briefly
review this method.

3
For a given HamiltonianH(λ;s), the dynamical trans-
formation is a unitary operatorV(s) that defines time
evolution of a given state
|Ψ(s)i=V(s)|Ψ(0)i,(6)

V(s) =TH(λ;s)V(s),(7)

operation time.   Here we assume that the Hamilto-
nian depends on time through time-dependent param-
etersλ(s) = (λ
1
, λ
2
,· · ·;s). For the same Hamiltonian,
the adiabatic transformation is a unitary operatorV
ad
(s)
that isometrically transforms the projection operators as

for a given state in thenth eigensector of the Hamilto-
nianH(λ;s) [
42]. Note that, in the context of shortcuts
to adiabaticity [39], the additional term is nothing but
the single-spectrum counterdiabatic term [
43]. If we con-
sider the adiabatic transformation of the full eigensectors
of the Hamiltonian, we should introduce the usual coun-
terdiabatic terms [
37,38] instead of Eq. (12).
Deviation of the dynamical transformation from the
adiabatic transformation can be estimated by using the

We determine time dependence of the parameter Λ

according to the geodesic equation (

reduces to [36]

We can numerically solve this equation by giving the ini-

holds, and thus we can also rewrite the geodesic equation
(

λ=C,(26)
with a constantC. In this case, we can numerically solve
this equation by giving the initial parameterλ(0) and
giving certain constantCinstead of

Because  parameter-derivative  of  the  Hamiltonian
(∂

) and the parity operator Π are commutative,
i.e.,

we can reduce summation in the metric (
27) so that the

ihas the identical parity to|Ψ

i. This
reduction is quite important for the present generation
schemes because we can avoid numerical divergence as-
sociated with gap closing and with the degeneracies of
the eigenstates.
B.  Generation of cat states
First we consider negative nonlinearityχ <0 to create
a cat state. We change the parameter Λ
−1
from 2 to 0.
An example of schedules optimized by quantum adiabatic
brachistochrone is shown in Fig.
1with the correspond-
ing linear schedule,λ(τ) = (τ /τ
f
)λ(τ
f
) + (1−τ /τ
f
)λ(0),
whereτ
f
=|χ|N t
f
is the generation time. Here we set
λ(0) = 2,λ(τ
f
) = 0, andC=−0.5. Quantum adiabatic
brachistochrone suggests fast decrease before approach-
ing the critical point, Λ
−1
&Λ
−1
c
= 1 (in the disordered
phase), and slow decrease after passing there (above the
critical point and in the ordered phase). We can observe
similar schedules with different generation timet
f
when
we set other values of the constantC. The relationship
between the generation timet

In the present generation scheme, the large quantum
Fisher information ensures the low excess energy, i.e.,
the generated state is close to a cat state, and poten-
tial usefulness in interferometry using the parity mea-
surement [
41]. Here we plot the rescaled quantum Fisher

tion time|χ|N t

resent the results by quantum adiabatic brachistochrone
and the open symbols represent the results by the lin-
ear schedule. Clearly quantum adiabatic brachistochrone
improves adiabaticity. Note that quantum Fisher infor-
mation monotonically increases during generation with
quantum adiabatic brachstochrone as seen in Fig.
4,
where the rescaled quantum Fisher informationF
Q

is plotted with respect to the rescaled time|χ|N t.
It is of interest if the present results can scale with
system size or not. In Fig.

generation time|χ|N t

except for small finite-size corrections when we change
the system sizeNfrom 50 to 150.  Here we further
study how much quantum adiabatic brachistochrone im-
proves the quantum Fisher information compared with
that of the linear schedule. We plot the improving rate

We now discuss why the schedules obtained by quan-
tum adiabatic brachistochrone take the form of Fig.
1
and they can improve adiabaticity.  We plot a part of
the energy spectra in Fig.6. Clearly it shows small en-
ergy gaps around the critical point Λ
−1
c
= 1 (although
there are some finite-size corrections), and thus we have
to slowly change the parameter around there. We can see
increase of the energy differences when the parameter be-
comes small, but quantum adiabatic brachistochrone still
suggests to change the parameter slowly. We can confirm
this reason by calculating the transition matrices

find that the transition matrix from the ground state to

0→2
becomes large when the pa-
rameter Λ

decreases in contrast to decrease of other el-
ements. This is why quantum adiabatic brachistochrone
suggests slow decrease even though energy differences be-
come large. Note that the transition matrices from the
ground state to odd numbered excited states vanishes
due to the parity conservation.
C.  Generation of spin squeezed states
Next, we consider positive nonlinearityχ >0 to cre-
ate a spin squeezed state. An example of schedules op-
timized by quantum adiabatic brachistochrone is shown
in Fig.
8.  In contrast to the case of negative nonlin-
earityχ  <0, quantum adiabatic brachistochrone just
suggests fast decrease at first and extremely slow de-
crease around|Λ

| ≈0. However, this final slow process
does not contribute so much to spin squeezing. In order

forC=−0.07.   The green  dotted line is  the corresponding

to show it, we consider two cases,|Λ
−1
|: 2→0 and
|Λ
−1
|: 2→0.005, withC=−0.07. The operation time
of the case|Λ

f
= 29.0, while
that of the case|Λ
−1
|: 2→0.005 is aboutχN t
f
= 12.5.
To decrease parameter|Λ

|from 0.005 to 0, we need an
additional generation timeχN t= 16.5, which is longer
than time to decrease|Λ

much during the process|Λ
−1
|: 0.005→0 as shown in
Fig.
9. Therefore, hereafter we only consider the process
|Λ
−1
|: 2→0.005. Note that in contrast to the case of
the quantum Fisher information for negative nonlinearity
χ <0, the spin squeezing parameter does not monoton-
ically decrease during generation by quantum adiabatic
brachistochrone. This is because both of (∆J
z
) andhJ
x
i
decrease and the spin squeezing parameter depends on
the rate of these quantities.
We calculate the spin squeezed parameter with vari-
ous values of the constantCand depict it in Fig.
10. As
we can see, quantum adiabatic brachistochrone decreases
the spin squeezed parameter, i.e., increases metrologi-
cal usefulness, except for an ultrafast regimeχN t
f
.3.
In this ultrafast regime, the spin squeezed parameter is
not so small, and thus we are not so interested in there.
Therefore, we can generally say that quantum adiabatic
brachistochrone improves generation of a spin squeezed
state.  In contrast to the case of negative nonlinearity
χ <0, system size dependence is quite small. For small
number of particles,N= 50, we calculate the square of

IV.  SUMMARY
In  this  paper,  we  considered quantum  adiabatic
brachistochrone in a bosonic Josephson junction to find
time-optimal schedules to create a cat state and a spin
squeezed state.  In contrast to counterdiabatic driving
in a bosonic Josephson junction [
29], quantum adiabatic
brachistochrone does not require any additional term.
We found that the optimized schedules are smooth and
monotonically decreasing curves, which could be easily
implemented in experiments. This simplicity of schedules
is advantage of quantum adiabatic brachistochrone com-
pared with optimal control theory [
23,26,28]. Note that,

8
for creation of a cat state, the parity conservation plays
an important role to avoid divergence of the quantum
geometric tensor. It is also advantageous that generated
states are automatically trapped by classical fixed points
after generation. In both generation of a cat state and
a spin squeezed state, we observed improvement of adia-
baticity and increase of metrological usefulness compared
with corresponding linear schedules.
Finally we discuss possibility to realize the present
schemes in experiments. In Ref. [
6], a Bose-Einstein con-
densate of
87
Rb showsχ= 2π×0.063 Hz forN= 200∼
450 atoms. Therefore, the prefactor of the rescaled time
can achieveχN≈178 s
−1
. Similarly, in Ref. [
9], it shows
χN≈188 s
−1
. For a time generating an intermediate
scale cat state or a well squeezed state,|χ|N t
f
≈10,
these values requires generation timet
f
≈50 ms. More-
over, in Ref. [
7], it showsχ= 0.49 s
−1
withN≈1250
by using the atom-chip-based technique and it achieves
χN≈613 s
−1
. For this parameter, the generation time
ist
f
≈16 ms, which is quite reasonable. Note that larger
number of atoms leads to faster decay of entanglement.
Therefore, one might be rather interested in generation
with several hundred atoms. According to Ref. [
9], the
nonlinearityχbehaves asχ∝1/
√
N, and thus it could
be possible to achieveχN≈368 s
−1
forN= 450 by us-
ing the atom-chip-based technique. It offers the genera-
tion timet
f
≈27 ms, which is also reasonable. Therefore
we could generate an intermediate scale cat state and a
well squeezed state in the near future.

We study the effect of a linear tunneling coupling between 2D systems, each separately exhibiting the topological
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. In the uncoupled limit, there are two phases: one where
the1-body correlation functions are algebraically decaying and the other with exponential decay. When the
linear coupling is turned on, a third BKT-paired phase emerges, in which1-body correlations are exponentially
decaying, while2-body correlation functions exhibit power-law decay. We perform numerical simulations in the
paradigmatic case of two coupledXYmodels at finite temperature, finding that for any finite value of the interlayer
coupling, the BKT-paired phase is present. We provide a picture of the phase diagram using a renormalization
group approach.
An ample variety of physical properties and phenomena
emerge when two many-body systems are coupled. There
are, of course, different ways of coupling interacting systems,
depending on the geometry of the uncoupled systems, on the
relevant degrees of freedom and on the way in which the
coupling is established. One of them is the so-calledweak
coupling, when the Hamiltonian term modeling the coupling
is a perturbation with respect to the uncoupled Hamiltonians.
In this case, if the two systems are separately described by a
macroscopic wavefunction – such as superfluids or supercon-
ductors – a relative phase between them emerges, as one can
see in the Josephson effect between superconductors [1,2],
Helium containers [3,4], Bose-Einstein condensates [5,6] and
ultracold fermions [7]. In these cases, the microscopic details
of the coupling enter only in the Josephson energy ruling the
maximum current that can flow through the junction.
Coupling two superfluids gives rise to a dissipationless
drag current that is often referred to as the Andreev-Bashkin
effect [8]. Previous investigations [9–11] have mainly focused
on the three-dimensional case, where strong enough drag
densities have been found to modify the order of the symmetry
breaking transition [12].  Indeed, when the coupling is no
longer a perturbation, one can expect that the bulk properties
of the uncoupled systems are significantly altered and that
new phases may emerge. A typical phenomenon induced by a
strong coupling is that the orderinthe systems is substituted
by a phasebetweenthem, therefore giving rise to an order
parameter expressed in terms of operators of both systems.
Countless different examples of couplings exist. Among the
simplest instances, one can imagine taking two one-dimensional
systems and couple them lengthwise, thus creating a ladder
geometry. Examples of this kind of coupling include magnetic
spin ladders, where two quantum spin chains are put in a
ladder geometry, see for instance Refs. [13,14]. The bilayer
structure, in which two two-dimensional systems are coupled,
is also a paradigmatic configuration, which has been studied
in numerous physical systems, ranging from graphene [15]
to quantum Hall systems [16] and dipolar models [17]. The
bilayer configuration is of particular relevance because it may
refer to two quantum or classical systems at finite temperature,
or – via the quantum-classical correspondence – to the ladder
geometry in which two quantum one-dimensional models at
zero temperature are coupled.
In this Letter, we address the emergence of a paired phase
when two models exhibiting a topological phase transition are
coupled. We will refer to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
(BKT) universality class [18] and study the effect of the coupling
of two BKT systems. We have two main motivations for our
study.  First, the BKT transition is not characterized by a
local order parameter and by the conventional spontaneous
symmetry breaking. Rather, one can locate the critical point
in which the system becomes superfluid by looking at the
correlation functions, exhibiting a power law (exponential)
decay in (outside) the superfluid phase.  BKT transitions
has been observed in several different 2D physical systems,
including superfluid Helium [19], superconducting films and
arrays [20,21], as well as bosonic [22,23] and fermionic [24]
ultracold systems.
The second motivation is related to the presence and rel-
evance of the coupling between 2D systems in a variety of
experimental systems, ranging from layered superconductors
[25,26] 2D two-component mixtures [11] and 2D ultracold
gases [27]. In the latter case, a single 2D ultracold system is ob-
tained by means of a suitably large transverse confinement: for
instance, one can realize a 2D geometry by confining the atoms
in a well of an optical lattice along the transverse direction,
arXiv:1907.06253v1  [cond-mat.stat-mech]  14 Jul 2019

2
with the transverse confinement frequency increasing with the
power laser and being&1−10kHz[28]. When two adjacent
minima of the vertical lattice are left populated, one would
have two 2D ultracold gases with tunable interlayer coupling.
In this way, one would study the effect of the bilayer coupling
on the 2D physics already observed in single layers [22–24].
Notice that in this case, the coupling is (for bosons) of the
formb

(whereb

creates a particle in theαlayer), thereby
corresponding to what we refer to as linear coupling.
Despite the rising interest of the theoretical community in
low dimensional binary mixtures [29–32], the influence of
interspecies coupling on universal behavior remains largely
unknown. In this context, a compelling question isi)“What is
the fate of the quasi-long-range order in the presence of a strong
coupling between two BKT systems?”. One may as well askii)
“Does quasi order occur in the mixed correlators of the coupled
system? If so, does it appear already at small couplings?". Pre-
vious attempts to answer these questions mainly focused on the
study of effective models for coupled topological excitations,
such as the coupled sine-Gordon model [33] and the coupled
Coulomb gases [34], evidencing the emergence of a composite
vortex gas phase as well as a second-order phase transition at
strong coupling. However, the results of these investigations
cannot be directly applied to our case, since the low energy
equivalence between two dimensional superfluids and topolog-
ical defect gases appears to be spoiled by the presence of the
bilayer coupling term.
To address the questions above, we consider the paradigmatic
case of two coupledXYmodels at finite temperature, based on
the expectation that similar features emerge for other classical
and quantum models in theXYuniversality class when linearly
coupled. The paradigmatic nature of the XY model results
in longly certified numerical tools, which allow us to reliably
investigate the bilayer case.

. Notice that
we are considering the symmetric case where the intralayer
coupling takes the same valueJon both layers. The critical
line separating the region with power law correlations from
the one with exponential correlations in model (1) has been
studied in literature [35].  Moreover, several properties of
coupled and layered XY models and two-components systems
have also been investigated [29,36–40], as well as coupled
3D XYmodels [41,42]. Here our focus is on the remarkable
quasi-order for pairs of spins on different layers that arises in a
2D bilayer system.
WhenK=0, the two layers are decoupled and the behavior
of the model is that of the standard 2D XY model [11,18]:
a superfluid phase and the normal state are separated by the
BKT transition occurring atT
BKT
≈0.893J[43–47]. The
normal state is characterized by the exponential decay of the
phase-phase correlator; in the superfluid phase, on the other
hand, one finds the peculiar algebraic decay of correlations
functions.
In the other limiting case,K→ ∞, the spins on the upper
and lower layer are constrained to be parallel,i.e.,φ

Results for the phase diagram.We want to study the full
phase diagram of the model, away from the two limiting cases
just analyzed. From the theory of bilayer systems and two-
component mixtures [11,48] one may expect that, apart from
the normal and superfluid phases of the BKT transition, a
phase involving variables (operators in the quantum case) of
both layers can emerge. The question is whether it emerges
only for large values of the couplingKor not. To make a
comparison with a similar, yet different, analytically solvable
case, let us consider the square lattice Askhin-Teller model
[49]: the Hamiltonian has a form similar to Eq. (1),H

The model has indeed a phase whose order parameter is〈st〉
[49].  However, apart from the fact that spin variables are
discrete in the Askhin-Teller model and continuous in the
bilayerXYmodel, there are two remarkable differences: first,
the coupling is quartic; second, the bilayerXYmodel exhibits
quasi-order and no spontaneous symmetry braking at finite
temperature.
To determine the full phase diagram of the bilayerXY
model, we perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the
Hamiltonian of Eq. (1) on a2×L×Llattice,Lbeing the linear
dimension of each layer. We varyβJandβK, where as usual

us call themc(k). All correlation functions are well fitted by

To tell apart the exponential and algebraic behaviour we
comparer
exp
with the linear system size used in the MC
simulation: ifr
exp
is smaller than twice the lattice dimensions,
then we mark the decay as exponential, otherwise it is marked
as algebraic, since the exponential characteristic lengthr
exp
is
neglectable when compared to the dimensions of the system
being studied. This allows us to obtain the phase diagram
shown in Fig. 1(a), identifying the three phases. We denote
byAthe usual superfluid BKT phase, characterized by the
algebraic decay ofc(k).  The correlation functionz(k)is
also found to be algebraically decaying in theAphase. The
normal phase, denoted byB, is characterized, as usual, by the
exponential decay ofc(k). We checked that in theBphasez(k)
is exponentially decaying, as well. Finally, we observe a third
Cphase, that is instead characterized by the exponential decay
ofc(k)and the algebraic decay ofz(k). Notice that, within the
precision we can achieve, for small values ofKone always has
a range of values ofJfor which there is theCphase. In other
words, theCphase extends up to vanishing values ofK.
We dub theCphase‘BKT-paired phase’, since each layer has
the1-body correlation functionc(k)decaying exponentially,
while the2-body correlation functionz(k)has an algebraic
behaviour. Sincez(k)is the correlation function betweenS

in the
different sites of the bilayer system.  The phase transition
betweenAandCappears to be a conventional BKT line, and in
agreement with Ref. [35]. It is worth noting that despite some
similarities between the phase diagram presented in Fig. 1 and
the one discussed in Ref. [33], we find no trace of any actual
symmetry breaking while our paired BKT phase appears also at
infinitely small coupling strengths. Moreover, the presence of
power law four point correlations was not noticed in previous
investigations.
To further numerically investigate these two transition lines
we resort to probability-changing cluster (PCC) algorithm,
introduced in Ref. [45] for the single-layer BKT transition.
Following the approach therein, at first the XY variables are
mapped onto two Ising models, using Wolff’s embedded cluster
formalism [51]. Subsequently the temperature of the system is
tuned in progressively smaller increments, looking for the
1
/2
percolation threshold of the Kasteleyn-Fortuin clusters defined
from each Ising model [45], signaling the BKT transition. It can
in fact be shown [52,53] that the spin-spin correlation function
〈S

〉equalsp
i j
, the probability that the siteiandjbelong
to the Kasteleyn-Fortuin same cluster, effectively linking the
presence of a percolating cluster spanning the whole system to
the onset of quasi-long-range order. In the present case one can
identify two different critical lines through the
1
/2
percolation
threshold criterion, depending on whether the clusters by which
percolation is identified are allowed to extend on a single layer
or on both layers, respectively. The results we obtain, shown
in Fig. 1(b), are compatible with the identification of theA,B
andCphases obtained by the study of correlation functions.
We now supplement this analysis by a RG calculation.
RG approach.Mermin-Wagner theorem [54] forbids spon-
taneous breaking of continuous symmetries in two dimensions
and, thus, only quasi-order, characterised by power law corre-
lations, can arise in our model. Such effect, which cannot be
reproduced within traditional perturbative approaches, can only
be described by RG theory via the explicit introduction of the
topological defects [18,55]. Within the functional RG frame-
work [56,57], it has been possible to derive non-perturbative
flow equations which correctly reproduce the Mermin-Wagner
theorem [58–60] forO(N)symmetric model, but the presence
of quasi-order in the thermodynamic limit forN=2andd=2
could not be found [61]. Recently, a new method has been
proposed [62] which allows to include in the traditional BKT
formalism the non-universal corrections arising at small and
intermediate scales.
We shall now employ a simplified version of this approach
to the bilayer case, showing how it is possible to reproduce
the MC phase diagram. First of all, we are going to derive the
mean field solution of our problem; then we are going to use it
to compute the effective spin stiffness in the low temperature
phase, which will serve as the initial condition of the traditional
BKT flow equations [63,64]. Finally, solving the BKT flow
equations with the MF initial condition, we will be able to
locate the vortex unbinding transition.
Within our framework it is convenient to employ a Hubbard-
Stratonovich transformation [20,65,66], in order to introduce
the continuous field representation of the bilayer model under
study. Following this procedure, the bilayer XY model can be
exactly mapped into two coupled complex|φ|

In order to proceed further with the analysis, one has to choose
a suitable value ofμ. In principle any value ofμ >2J+Kis a
valid choice and the choice ofμshall not alter the behavior of
the model [65]. However, when approximations are employed,
aμ-dependence of the result can be found [62,67]. In the
following, we are going to only consider the continuum limit of
the kinetic action in Eq.(7), discarding lattice effects, thus we
may extend our choices also toμ <2J+Kand, in particular, we
will fixμ=K, consistently with the optimal choice discussed
in [62] for a single XY layer.
It is now possible to compute the two MF phase boundaries
imposing the vanishing of one of the two massesμ
±
at each
phase boundary. According to this argument the lower phase
boundary in Fig. 1(c) is obtained by the vanishing ofμ
+
, while
μ

becomes zero at the upper boundary. Above each boundary
one of the fieldsφ

acquires a finite expectation value thus
violating the Mermin-Wagner theorem. The field expectation

As anticipated, the low energy behaviour of the model cannot
be described simply considering the static MF solution, which
provides an unphysical symmetry breaking scenario. In order
to correct the MF picture and provide a reliable phase diagram,
the effect of vortex fluctuations at low energy shall be included.
In this perspective, it is convenient to consider the action(6)in

In the latter action the two phases are uncoupled and two
distinguished BKT transitions are found. Latter statement can
be proven by mapping each independent quadratic phase term
into a sine-Gordon model [62].
The physics of the transitions is fully described, at this
approximation level, by the effective phase stiffnessρ

In order to derive Eqs.(13)–(14)one has to assume a UV
regularization, which traditionally relies in considering the
Coulomb gas charges as hard disks of finite radius [63].
Using the MF expectations obtained solving the saddle point
Eq.(10)we can now derive the theoretical prediction for the two
BKT transition line reported in panel (b) of Fig. 1. The upper
transition line, which corresponds to the conventional BKT
transition, comes from the unbinding of theθ

phase boundary appears to be flat at our approximation level
since we solve Eq.(10)separately forφ

due to the difficulties encountered in solving the two coupled
equations for the expectation values. On the other hand theK
dependence of the lower transition line is only due to the explicit
Kdependence in them
+
factor and it is in good agreement with
the MC prediction.
Finally, we should compare our results with the correspond-
ing results for two linearly-coupled Ising models. Denoting
byS
i
andT
i
the spins in the two layers, a phase with order
parameter〈ST〉,0cannot exist (in the paramagnetic phase
with〈S〉=〈T〉=0). The same is occuring for the two linear
coupledXYmodels treated in this Letter,i.e.there is no
phase with order parameter〈cos(φ+ψ)〉, in agreement with
the Mermin-Wagner theorem. What is present is indeed a BKT
of the pairs, specific of coupledtwo-dimensionalsystems with
O(2)symmetry, not contradicting the previous result.
Conclusions.We investigated the occurrence of a BKT-
paired phase in coupledXYmodels, corresponding to an
exponential (algebraic) decay for the1-body (2-body) correla-
tion functions. We found that the third phase is present even
for very small linear couplings between the layers, within the
precision of our simulations. Furthermore, we presented an
RG treatment which was found to be in agreement with the
aforementioned results. Our findings call for a more systematic
study of finite size-scaling effects in theJ−Kphase diagram:
experiments with coupled 2D ultracold gases are performed
on lattices with a linear size of tens up to a few hundreds of
lattices sites, therefore motivating the study of the presence of
the BKT-paired phase in realistic setups.
Furthermore, an exciting perspective is represented by a
comparison of the present results with the ones obtained for
other types of couplings, such as quartic ones, and to consider
the case of differentJ’s in the layer. A systematic analysis
for smallKdone at larger sizes would also be important
in clarifying whether the critical value for the presence
of the BKT transition is zero as the RG approach seems
to suggest. Moreover, we think as well that it would be a
deserving subject of future investigations to further analyse
the order to quasi-order transition between phasesBandCof
Fig. 1. Finally, we mention that an interesting perspective is
represented by the comparison of our results with analytical
findings from suitably derived theories where two sine-Gordon
models are coupled in a way fixed by the microscopic coupling.

We investigate the physics of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid of spin-polarised fermionic quantum
gas superimposed on an ion chain. This compound system features (attractive) long-range inter-
species interactions. By means of density matrix renormalisation group techniques we compute the
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid parameter and speed of sound as afunction of the two quantum defect
parameters, namely the even and odd short-range phases which characterise the short-range part of
the atom-ion polarisation potential. We find that the properties of the system depend significantly
on the short-range phases due to the atom-ion interaction. These dependencies can be controlled, for
instance, by manipulating the ions’ internal state. This allows modification of the static properties
of the quantum liquid via external driving of the ionic impurities.
I.  INTRODUCTION
The quantum physics of one-dimensional (1D) interact-
ing systems is rather peculiar as quantum fluctuations
are strong and only collective excitations are possible,
i.e.  there are no single-particle excitations typical of
Fermi liquids. Because of this, when the transverse de-
grees of freedom are frozen and a system acts as if one-
dimensional, counterintuitive phenomena occur, such
as fermionisation (bosonisation) of bosons (fermions)
1,2
,
perfect “collisional transparency” of particles
3
(equiva-
lent to zero crossing of the two-body coupling constant),
enhanced inter-particle interactions in a ballistic expan-
sion
4
, and unusual cooling mechanisms
5,6
, to mention
a few. While decades ago such manifestations were re-
garded as mere mathematical curiosities, the advent of
degenerate atomic quantum gases has allowed the veri-
fication of such predictions, as the atomic confinement
can be designed via optical laser fields
7
or, alternatively,
magnetic field landscapes can be engineered by means of
tailored configurations of current-carrying wires in atom
chips
8
. The understanding of the fundamental underly-
ing mechanisms behind such phenomenology is not only
of academic interest, but also has important practical
applications, as the progressive miniaturisation of elec-
tronic devices is such that, for instance, any quantitative
description of transport in extremely reduced spatial di-
mensions and extremely low temperatures must be quan-
tum mechanical.
Very recently, experimental advances in bringing differ-
ent atomic systems together to form a hybrid quantum
system have opened new possibilities for quantum physics
research
9
.  For instance, Rydberg
10–12
or other neutral
impurities
13–20
in quantum gases allow us to study the
dressing of the atomic impurities with gas excitations and
of mediated interactions
21–27
as well as to utilise impu-
rities to probe bath correlations and temperature
28–31
.
In addition, charged or dipolar impurities in degenerate
atomic gases allow us to study polarons in the strong
coupling regime
32
, to quantum simulate Fr ̈ohlich-type
Hamiltonians
33
as well as extended Hubbard
34–37
and
lattice gauge theories
38
.  Experiments with an ion im-
mersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate
39–45
, and in a
Fermi gas
46–49
have been realised in recent years, albeit
not yet in the deep quantum regime of atom-ion collisions.
Specifically low dimensional quantum physics with impu-
rities exhibits a variety of unusual quantum phenomena.
A few examples of this are: Bloch oscillations experienced
by a moving impurity in a strongly correlated bosonic
gas without the presence of an optical lattice potential
50
,
quantum flutters
51
(namely injected supersonic impuri-
ties that never come to a full stop), so-called infrared-
dominated dynamics
52
and clustering of impurities
27
.
Motivated by these advances and by recent exper-
iments that combine ytterbium ions with fermionic
lithium atoms
47,48
, we investigate the ground state prop-
erties of a spin-polarised fermionic quantum gas that is
superimposed on an ion chain (see Fig. 1), where the
latter is treated statically
53
. Given the fact that the mo-
tion of the ions and their internal states can be precisely
controlled in experiments, atom-ion scattering properties
can thus be manipulated. This can be useful e.g. for in-
ducing macroscopic self-trapping or tunnelling dynamics
in a bosonic Josephson junction
54,55
. Here we are inter-
ested in the impact of the long-ranged atom-ion polarisa-
tion potential on the 1D quantum fluid statical properties.
Specifically, we employ density matrix renormalisation
group techniques to extract the Tomongaga-Luttinger liq-
uid (TLL) parameter and the speed of sound, which fully
characterise the low energy physics of the atomic fluid.
We find that these quantities have a significant depen-
dence on the short-range physics of the atom-ion scatter-
ing (i.e., short-range phases), which can be controlled, for
instance, by so-called confinement-induced
56,57
or Fano-
Feshbach resonances
58,59
.  Thus, our findings demon-

II.  THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
In this section we describe the system we study, the
interaction between the two atomic species and between
the fermionic atoms, as well as provide the basic ingredi-
ents of TLL theory that will be used later in the paper.
A.  System Hamiltonian
We consider an ensemble of identical ultracold atoms,
which are spin-polarised fermions, confined to one spa-
tial dimension in the background of an ion chain with
the ions organised as an evenly-spaced Coulomb crystal.
The ions are considered static, namely their motion is ne-
glected, e.g., because of tight confinement or heavy ions
and light atoms. We use realistic atom-ion interactions
via an accurate mapping of quantum defect theory (QDT)
to an effective interaction potential that also includes the
asymptotic power-law tail of the atom-ion forces. For the
atom-atom interactions, we use instead effective field the-
ory (EFT), which is valid at low energies and amenable to
numerical treatment

caused by the interaction between the ion electric field
and the induced electric dipole of the atom.  At long

pointed out, we focus on the static ion scenario and a very

This pair appears to be the most promising to attain the
ultracold regime in radio-frequency traps

Finally, the atom-atom interaction can be treated
as  short  range  two-body  interaction  with  lattice
EFT
61
, where the first natural non-zero term affect-
ing spin-polarized fermions is the lowest order odd-wave
interaction
65
. The lattice, with a finite spacing, provides
a regularisation of the Cheon-Shigehara interaction
61,66
,
and its coupling constant is renormalised by fixing the
atom-atom odd-wave scattering lengtha
p
.
B.  Model ion-atom potential
The  previously  introduced  polarisation  potential,
Eq. (2) is state-independent, in that its form does not
depend on the internal electronic configuration of the
atom and the ion, only the polarisability. However, at
short distances, below a few nanometers, the form of the
interaction changes to a generally unknown form.
At that spatial range the electronic configurations of
the two particles enter into play and render the interac-
tion state-dependent. Such a reliance is included theoret-
ically by assuming that the only effect of the short-range
part of the potential on the atom-ion wavefunction is
to induce phase shifts.  This effect is accounted for by
introducing short-range phasesφ
e,o
, which correspond
to quantum defect parameters in the context of quan-
tum defect theory
62,67
.  Practically, this is handled by
imposing appropriate boundary conditions in the limit
|x−X| →0.  In this limit, the polarisation potential
becomes extremely dominant so that all other energies
can be neglected.  In 1D such conditions are given by
(X= 0)

being the collisional energy at threshold. The short-range
phases are free parameters which must be fixed to re-
produce the scattering phase shifts found in experiment.
Furthermore, the short-range phases fix the values of the
even and odd-wave scattering lengths as
a
e,o
1D
=R
∗
cot(φ
e,o
).(6)
Hence, tuning the short-range phases means to control
the above scattering lengths, and therefore the effective
1D atom-ion interaction strength.  The above QDT is
cumbersome to implement in a many-body Hamiltonian
formalism.  In order to circumvent this difficulty, we
use an effective interaction that faithfully reproduces the
long-distance tail of the atom-ion potential, as well as the
low-energy phase shifts. In particular, we use the model
potential

which is characterised by three parameters:v

We fixv
0
at 3ωso that the atom wave function (almost)
vanishes atx= 0, andγis chosen such that
γ≥γ

In this way, the Gaussian is kept from interfering with
the long-range part. We can systematically map the free
parameterωand the semi-restricted parameterγto the
quantum defect parameters (φ
e
,φ
o
) (see Appendix A for
more details). This means that we can use this poten-
tial for numerical modelling, while still considering the
quantum defect parameters the tunable parameters of
the system.
C.  Atom-atom interaction and discretisation
We shall solve the many-body problem by discretising
it in an equally spaced grid with spacingdand evaluating
it in the continuum limitd→0. The discrete Hamilto-
nianH

lattice EFT, where the first natural non-zero term affect-
ing spin-polarized fermions is the lowest order odd-wave
interaction

gives significant effects while keeping numerical stabil-
ity.  Note that odd-wave interactions may be tuned
through e.g. Feshbach resonances or confinement induced
resonances

.
To evaluate the ground state of the discrete Hamil-
tonian we will employ numerical variational calcula-
tions using the density matrix renormalisation group
(DMRG)
75,76
. For such calculations it is convenient to
express the Hamiltonian in the characteristic energyt(d),

For the range of QDT parameters we investigate,
the atom-ion interaction supports one or two two-body
bound states.  For ions in a finite lattice with open
boundaries, this means we have two type of states (see
Fig. 2): states deep in the effective atom-ion potential
which would not exist in a flat potential, corresponding to
ion-bound (IB) atoms, and a discrete set of states above
the IB states similar to those found in a 1D quantum
well, which we will call trap-bound (TB) since the dis-
cretisation is due to the presence of the (box-like) trap.

such fillings must be considered to take into account the
difference in the number of IB states.
D.  Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory
A system of interacting fermions in one dimension is
fully characterised at low energy by the renormalized
speed of sounduand the TLL parameterK, which is a di-
mensionless parameter withK <1 for repulsive fermions,
K= 1 for non-interacting fermions, andK >1 for attrac-
tive fermions. The goal of our study is to investigate the
impact of an ion lattice on such parameters. The ground
state properties of the quantum fluid can be analysed
through the bosonised Hamiltonian

whereθandφare the standard bosonic fields. This ef-
fective Hamiltonian is a linearisation of Eq. (1) around
the Fermi points. We will extractuandKas functions
of the quantum defect parameters, by treating the micro-
scopic Hamiltonian, Eq. (1), in a DMRG calculation and
evaluating the ground state properties of systems with
varying quantum defect parameters. This will allow us
to extract the LL parameters using the methods outlined
below. Let us stress here that the discretisation has no
physical significance, but it is done merely to allow a
numerical treatment of the continuous system.
Specifically, we will consider a finite system withN

sites (grid points) thus having a total lengthL=d(N

ions. When

The factor 1/2 in the second line of Eq. (20) accounts for
the spin polarisation. The derivative must be approxi-
mated as a finite difference, since the number of particles
is discrete, and we use a difference of two atoms to avoid
any effects which might arise due to the differences be-
tween having an odd and an even number of particles.
By computing the ground state energy of the system for
different numbersN

of fermions, we can thus calculate
both LL parameters by using Eqs. (18) and (20).

In the rest of the paper we will assume an ion density of
N
I
/L= 0.25/R
∗
. This means that in the thermodynamic
limit, the ions have a separation ofD= 4R
∗
, which for
the atom-ion pair
6
Li /
174
Yb
+
corresponds to 279.2 nm.
In the case ofN
I
= 7, the ion spacing isD= 4.6R
∗
,
corresponding to 321.1 nm. For the atom-ion pair
40
K /
174
Yb
+
the ion spacing would correspond to 1.1μm. For
instance, for a
174
Yb
+
ion chain withN
I
= 7 ions and
a radiofrequency of 2π×2 MHz, the minimal separation
is about 1.2μm, whereas with a radiofrequency of 2π×
10 MHz it is 398.22 nm
81
. Although the latter frequency
is higher than typical values encountered in experiments,
the quoted separations can be obtained by just generat-
ing time-dependent fields of higher frequency. Attempts
at reaching ion separations that are currently attained
in trapped ion experiments is beyond the capabilities of
our DMRG simulations. Nonetheless, since the smaller
ion separation we have considered, i.e.D= 4R
∗
, is large
enough that the ion potentials have negligible overlap
(see also Fig. 2), we do not expect any qualitative differ-
ences from increasing the separation.
III.  RESULTS
The following results were obtained by using the
DMRG algorithm as outlined above.  Errors onKare
the 2σconfidence intervals in the linear fits used for ex-
trapolation.  To ensure the correct implementation of
our method we tested the calculation without ions. For
a
p
= 0 we find the free fermion limitK= 1.0000(2), as
expected for non-interacting atoms, while the slightly at-
tractive interactiona
p

givesK= 1.0525(9).
This is similar to the result we get by approximating
the fermions as hard rods with lengtha

ble I. In the rest of the text the systems with two bound
states will be said to be in the “strong” ion domain (since
the potential has deeper wells and higher central Gaus-
sian), while the systems with one bound state will be
said to be in the “weak” ion domain. In the QDT pa-

tigation of TB states, and will be discussed further in
Section III B below. Note that ions located on an edge
site will always have one bound state, which is a finite
size effect. Further technical details can be found in Ap-
pendix B. Finally, for all plots in the following section,
the points signify calculation results and the surface is a
linear interpolation.
A.  Ion-bound atomic states
The introduction of ions into our system of interacting
fermions induces a significant effective attraction between
the interacting atoms, as shown in Fig. 3, where the
K-parameter varies approximatively from 1.20 to 1.58,
with a dip to 1 in the deep weak domain (above the
dashed line). This depends mostly onφ
e
, and peaks for
−0.3< φ
e
/π <−0.2. For values larger than this, we see
hints at a sharp dip towards the non-interacting limit. In
Fig. 4 we show the speed of sounduof the system of inter-
acting atoms and ions. Generally, the presence of the ions
lowers this speed considerably compared to the Fermi ve-

in the strong domain. Since we are effectively introduc-
ing potential wells and barriers into the system, it is to
be expected that collective excitations across the systems
will be damped by these “obstacles”, corresponding to a
lower speed of sound, or equivalently a higher effective
mass of the fermions.
B.  Trap-bound atomic states
Due to the previously mentioned transition in the num-
ber of IB states per ion, in order to study the behaviour of
a system of TB states we must consider different fillings
in the different domains. In the weak domain we consider

can only host one odd-wave bound state. Fig. 5 shows
thef

filling over both domains, and withKvarying
between approximatively between 1.03 and 1.08, we see
that the ions barely tune it away from the 1.05 value from
the system with no ions, with slightly induced attraction
in the weak domain. Fig. 6 shows thef
TB,2
filling over
both domains, and withKvarying from 0.56 to 0.95 we
can see a clear induced repulsion. Remarkably, there is a
smooth transition between domains for both fillings, but
drastically differentK-values between the fillings, sug-
gesting that the deciding factor in the value ofKis not
the density of TB or IB states, but rather the total num-
ber of atoms per ion.  The smooth transition between
domains indicate that the difference between a low TB
state and a shallow IB state has very little influence on
the physics of our system.
Taken together, Figs. 3, 5 and 6 indicate that the effect
of the ions can be separated into three different categories
1.Induced attraction.This is the case whenN

and the atoms are bound relatively deep in the ion
potential.
2.No effect or small induced attraction. This is the
case whenN

in the weak domain.
3.Induced   repulsion.This  is  the  case  when
N
A
= 3N
I
−2 in the strong ion domain, with ten-
dency towards the non-interacting limit in the weak
domain.
This suggests that the overall qualitative nature of the
interaction is mainly due to the number of atoms, while

7
in both attractive and repulsive cases it can be tuned
both close to and far from the free fermion limitK= 1.
Current experiments with ytterbium ions and lithium
atoms
47
show very low Langevin collisional rates, thus
indicating that atoms do not occupy bound states within
the ions, and so the points 2 and 3 above are the most
experimentally relevant. Note that these effects are gen-
uinely induced by the atom-ion scattering physics, that
is, the occurrence of one or two bound states at threshold
is a physical effect tuneable by Feshbach or confinement-
induced resonances.
IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOKS
We have investigated the ground state properties of a
fermionic quantum fluid superimposed on a uniform ion
chain. Particularly, we have assessed the Luttinger liquid
parametersKandu, which fully characterise the ground
state of the spin-polarised Fermi gas and its low-energy
excitations. Our goal was to analyse the reliance of the
LL parameters on the short-range phases of the atom-
ion scattering. To this aim, we performed numerical den-
sity matrix renormalisation group simulations on a high-
resolution discretised fermionic Hamiltonian modelling a
static linear ion chain. Thus, we have been able to map
the Luttinger liquid parameters to the two short-range
phases characterising the atom-ion polarisation potential.
By changing these scattering parameters, e.g. via exter-
nal driving of the ionic impurities, we have shown that
the Luttinger liquid parameters can be tuned within a
broad range of values. While the speed of sound is gener-
ally decreased, corresponding to a hindering of collective
excitations by the ions, the interaction as measured by
Khas a more intricate behaviour.  Depending on the
density of the initially weakly attractive atoms, changing
the ion scattering parameters can tune the interaction
within a repulsive regime, an attractive regime or have
completely negligible effect. The result of most immedi-
ate experimental relevance is the induced repulsion.
Finally, future work could address the dimensional
crossover by replacing the setup we investigated purely in
1D with an atomic waveguide, where the motional trans-
verse degrees of freedom are taken into account, too. Re-
cently the analytical solution of the 3D scattering prob-
lem of a trapped atom interacting with an array of con-
tact potentials, i.e. representing the static scattering cen-
tres akin to the ions, was presented
84
. Hence, one could
solve the many-particle problem using this analytical so-
lution and investigate the impact of the transverse con-
finement of the atoms on the LL parameters and excita-
tion spectrum of the liquid in order to understand the in-
terplay between external confinement and impurity-atom
scattering characteristics. An alternative approach could
be by means of bosonisation techniques, where the trans-
verse modes are coupled
85
. Moreover, another interesting
research direction is to study the role of spatial inhomo-
geneities in the impurity-atom interaction strength, thus
adding controlled disorder in the system.

Appendix A: The model potential
For the sake of numerical efficiency, we have chosen the
atom-ion model potential parameters within the range
1≤
ω

)

,

≤10.(A1)
The mapping between the QDT parameters, i.e. short-
range phases, and model potential parameters is per-
formed by following this procedure:
1. We choose some values forωandγwithin the range
outlined above as well asE=k
2
(all parameters
are in units ofE
∗
andR
∗
), the latter of which must
be small (i.e. in the low-energy limit), but positive.
We then use the Numerov method
87
to solve the
Schr ̈odinger equation for the two-body atom-ion
problem for this potential by iterating the wave-
function fromx= 0 tox≫R
∗
.
2. We determine the phase shiftsξ
e,o
of the solution at
large distances, i.e. far from the ion, by comparing
the logarithmic derivative of the solution to a plane

gives the mapping.
We note that the last step of this procedure always yields
a numerical error, i.e. the difference between the QDT
result and the model potential will be around 10
−12
. We
also note that for perfect precision in the mapping, the
atom-ion wave-function would have to be zero at the ion
position.  This is only true for the model potential to
a good approximation, since the model parameterv
0
is
finite.
Appendix B: DMRG simulations and extrapolation
The DMRG solutions were found by using the imple-
mentation from theITensorlibrary
88
. The time taken
and accuracy achieved depends on a number of supplied
parameters:
Sweeps:The number of sweeps to achieve convergence
depends heavily on the size and complexity of
the system of interest, ranging from∼100 for
small atom-only systems with simple interactions,
to 1000-2000 for large atom-ion systems with many
atoms and all interactions turned on.
Cutoff:DMRG uses a singular value decomposition
(SVD) procedure, where all singular values below
this cutoff value are truncated. The value was kept
similar to that of Refs.
77,78
, namely∼10
−13
.
Maximum bond dimension:It was found that set-
ting this value at 1000 gives a good convergence
time.
TheITensorimplementation  automatically  con-
verts common operators into matrix product operators
(MPOs). This renders the implementation of the Hamil-
tonian as well as the extraction of the ground state energy
and the density profile

rather simple. A straightforward way to confirm that the
algorithm has converged is to check the symmetry of the
density profile. The true ground state will be completely
symmetric around the center of the trap, but it was found
that the DMRG algorithm would only return states with
symmetric density profiles once it had completely con-
verged.
The parameter space which gave significant effects
while being numerically feasible was found to be (21),
whereas the combinations (22) give a nice spread of quan-
tum defect parameters. Smaller parameters would make
the features of the potential too weak, while larger pa-
rameters tend to give an non-smooth potential, requiring
a finer lattice to properly resolve. Within this parameter
range it was found that a lattice constant ofd∼0.01R
∗
with∼400 sites per ion was a minimum for reliable cal-
culations. Extrapolation was done from the results of cal-
culations with 5 to 12 ions, a density ofN
I
/L= 0.25/R
∗
and a lattice separation ofd= 0.01667R
∗
, see Fig. B1.
Since the data points cluster closer together towards
1/N
s
→0, and to have more efficient calculations, it was
chosen to only extrapolate usingN
I
= 5,6,7,9,12, which
still gives a reliable extrapolation. Forω/(R
∗
)
−4
<5 the
N
I
= 5 results were found to be unreliable and had to be
excluded from the extrapolation. The remaining points
sufficed for reliable extrapolation.
The main system of interest in this paper is that with
trap-bound filling and non-zero atom-atom interactions.
It is however noteworthy that the extrapolation proce-
dure failed for the ion-bound filling when atom-atom in-
teractions were neglected (i.e.V
AA
= 0).  One would
expect this to be a simpler system to work with, but our
numerical procedure failed in this case. Extraction ofK
using Eq. (18) can be readily done by seeing that the sum
is symmetric aroundj
c
, meaning the imaginary parts of
the exponential cancel, and one is left with
ˆn(k) = ˆn(−k) =
N

which is real and even, and which can be converted to an
MPO and applied to the ground state before calculating
the overlap in Eq. (18).

The standard Bloch oscillation normally refers to the oscillatory tunneling dynamics of quantum particles in a
periodic lattice plus a linear gradient. In this work we theoretically investigate the generalized form of the Bloch
oscillation in the presence of additional higher order gradients, and demonstrate that the higher order gradients
can significantly modify the tunneling dynamics, particularly in the spectrum of the density oscillation. The
spectrum of the standard Bloch oscillation is composed of a single prime frequency and its higher harmonics,
while the higher-order gradients in the external potentialgive rise to fine structures in the spectrum around each
of these Bloch frequencies, which are composed of serieses of frequency peaks. Our investigation leads to a two-
fold consequence to the applications of Bloch oscillationsfor measuring external forces: For one thing, under a
limited resolution of the measured spectrum, the fine structures would manifest as a blur to the spectrum, and
leads to intrinsic errors to the measurement. For another, given that the fine structures could be experimentally
resolved, they can supply more information of the external force than the strength of the linear gradient, and be
used to measure more complicated forces.

I.  INTRODUCTION
Ultracold atoms, owing to their perfect isolation to the en-
vironment and flexible tunability, have become an ideal plat-
form for fundamental physics research and practical applica-
tions [1, 2]. Among these investigations, a paradigm is the
Bloch oscillation (BO) of ultracold lattice atoms, which not
only reveals the wave natures of quantum particles, but also
finds various applications,e.g.in precision measurements.
BO, known as the periodic oscillation of a particle subject
to a periodic potential plus a liner gradient, was firstly intro-
duced in solid-state systems [3], and have been experimen-
tally explored in various ultracold atomic ensembles, such
as with Bose-Einstein condensates [4–12], degenerate Fermi
gases [13], and strongly correlated lattice atoms [14].  BO
of ultracold atoms has been theoretically proposed to be ap-
plied for the measurement of the gravity acceleration [15],the
nonlinear interaction between atoms [16], as well as forcesat
short distances [17, 18], such as the Casimir force and even
the non-Newtonian gravity forces. In experiments, the high
precision measurements ofh/m
Rb
[7, 8], and the gravity ac-
celeration [9–13] have also been performed.
The standard BO can also be generalized to more compli-
cated setups, which bring in new effects and applications. For
instance, temporal modulations of the lattice potential [19–
23] or the interaction strength [24] have been demonstrated
to induce the so-called super Bloch oscillations, which can
be used to transport atoms in the lattice with a controllable
manner. The BOs in nonuniform lattices, such as aperiodic
lattices [25, 26], disorder lattices [27] as well as zigzag and
helix lattices [28] have also been extensively investigated. In
this work, we consider an alternative generalization scheme

of BO in optical lattices, in which higher order gradients are
taken into account besides the linear one. This generalization,
termed as generalized Bloch oscillation (GBO), is in favor of
the realistic setups of optical lattices in the presence of ex-
ternal forces, such as gravity or Casimir force, which contains
not only the linear but also higher order gradients. We demon-
strate that, on the one hand, in the presence of the higher order
gradients, the dynamics of the lattice atoms still maintains an
oscillatory behavior. On the other hand and more importantly,
the frequency spectrum of GBO is significantly modified and
the higher order gradients give rise to the fine structures inthe
spectrum, manifested as splitting of the Bloch frequencies,i.e.
the prime frequency and its higher harmonics, into series of
frequency peaks. The fine structures present a strong influence
on the measurement of external forces based on the tunneling
dynamics of lattice atoms. For one thing, in the measurements
of the linear forces by the Bloch frequencies, the fine struc-
ture induced by the residual higher order gradients, broadens
the measured frequency peaks of the corresponding Bloch fre-
quencies under a limited experimental resolution of the spec-
trum and leads to intrinsic errors to the measurements. For
another, provided an improved resolution of the spectrum to
identify the fine structure, it is possible to decode the strength
of the higher-order gradients from the fine structure, and holds
the potential in precision measurement of complicated forces.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present the
Generalized Bloch oscillation in optical lattices with quadratic
gradient, including the setup (II A), analytical results (II B)
and numerical verifications (IIC). A brief discussion are given
in Sec. III.

II.  GENERALIZED BLOCH OSCILLATION IN OPTICAL
LATTICES WITH QUADRATIC GRADIENT
A.  Setup
In this work, we consider the quantum dynamics of ultra-
cold atoms confined in one-dimensional optical lattices in the
presence of an external potential, containing gradients ofdif-
ferent orders. The interaction between atoms is set to be zero,
which can be experimentally realized either by tuning the in-
teraction to approaching zero via Feshbach resonance [10–
12], or directly loading single atoms to the optical lattices
[14]. Under the condition of non-interacting lattice atoms, the
setup is reduced to a single-particle one, with the Hamiltonian
given as:

In our investigations, the atoms are initially loaded to a sin-

the following, we shift the origin of the coordinate to the po-

can be directly applied to these cases.
Before proceeding to the GBO, let us recall the main char-
acteristics of the standard BO. In the standard BO that the
atoms are initially loaded to a single site of an optical lattice
in the presence of a linear gradient,i.e.V
α
=V

δ

, the
atoms undergo a breathing-type periodic oscillation around
the initial site, and the spectrum of BO is composed of a sin-
gle prime frequency and its higher harmonics. The prime fre-
quencyω

/~klinearly depends on the strength of the
gradient, which stimulates various applications in precision
measurements [7–9, 13, 15–18]. In this work we extend to in-
vestigate the generalized Bloch oscillation (GBO) in the pres-
ence of higher order gradients of the external potential, with a
focus on the spectrum of GBO.
B.  Analytical results
1.  GBO under a quadratic tilt

ternal potential composed of a linear and a quadratic gra-
dient,i.e.V

ing frequency spectrum,ρ

, whereiindexes the site of
lattice. Our main results can be summarized as follows: For
one thing, the one-body densityρ
i
(
t
)
of quadratic GBO still
maintains a periodic structure. For another, and more impor-
tantly, a major difference between the standard BO and the
quadratic GBO arises in the spectrum. In the case of the stan-
dard BO, the spectrumρ
i
(
ω
)
is composed of peaks located at
ω
B
and its higher harmonics, while the additional quadratic
gradient splits each of these Bloch frequencies into a series of
equidistant peaks. Taking the equidistant peaks aroundω
B
for instance, the location of these peaks can be derived as

.(3)
Shown from the above equations, the centered value and the
spacing of the equidistant peaks are linearly dependent on the
strength of the linear and the quadratic gradients, respectively.
The derivation of the above equations is done by applying the
first-order perturbation theory, in which the quadratic term is
taken as the perturbation to the Wannier-Stark states [29, 30].
The detailed derivation can be found in the appendix.
Equations (2) and (3) indicate that in the use of BO for
measuring the linear gradient, the residual of the quadratic
term can splits the prime frequency into a series of peaks. In
the case that the fine structure composed of the split peaks
could not be well resolved in the measured spectrum, it be-
haves as the broadening of the measured profile of the prime
frequency, and consequently induces errors to the measure-
ment. On the other hand, given that the fine structure of the
equidistant peaks could be resolved in experiments, we sug-
gest that the quadratic GBO could be used to realize the si-
multaneous measurements of the linear and quadratic gradi-
ents of an external potential. The measurement scheme in-
volves performing GBO of lattice atoms, and extracting the
strength of the linear and the quadratic gradients from the av-
eraged value and the spacing of the equidistant peaks, respec-
tively. Comparing to the differential measurement strategy of
the quadratic gradient, which requires measuring the external
force at different locations, the GBO can lead to anin-situand
simultaneous measurement of the linear and quadratic gradi-

3
ents, which could be particularly useful in situations within
short distances.
2.  GBO under a general tilt

tential, which is composed of arbitrarily many gradients of

quency peaks, located around each of the Bloch frequencies

The results given in equations (4) and (5) again demon-
strates that the higher-order gradients generate fine structures
in the spectrum, which encodes the detailed information of
the composed external potential. In the case that the linear
gradient is the dominant term of the external potential and
the higher-order gradients behaves as a perturbation, the fine
structure can induce errors in measuring the linear gradient
with the standard BO. Moreover, the results also indicate that
the characteristic frequencies of GBO still encodes the in-
formation of the external forces, in terms of the strength of
the gradients of different orders, which could be explored for
measuring forces containing multiple gradients. It shouldalso
be pointed out that in equations (4) and (5), the locations ofthe
frequency peaks become dependent on the lattice parameters,
such as the hopping strength, which requires careful choice
and calibrations of these parameters for applications based on
GBO.
C.  Numerical verifications
In this section we present numerical results on the GBO,
in terms of the temporal one-body density oscillationρ

and the corresponding integrated spectrumρ

tunneling process. Since we focus on the non-interacting sys-
tem, our simulation reduces to a single-particle problem, in
which the atom is initially localized to a single site, and then
released to the whole lattice. The simulation is performed in
the real space, despite that our analytical investigation is based
on the Bose-Hubbard model. In our simulations, the energy,
time and frequency are rescaled with respect to the recoil en-
ergyE

1.  The Quadratic case
We firstly simulate the quadratic GBO, of which the exter-
nal potential is composed of the linear and quadratic gradi-
ents. The simulation results are shown in figure 1. In fig-
ure 1(a) and 1(b), we compare the density oscillation of the
standard BO and the quadratic GBO. Comparing to BO, the
density profile of the quadratic GBO still maintains a periodic
oscillation around the initially occupied site, while the sym-
metry between the left and right wings of the profile breaks.
Roughly speaking, in both wings the propagation downwards
is faster than upwards the gradient, which results in a tilted
structure of the density profile as shown in figure 1(b). This
parity symmetry breaking induces the oscillation of the center
of mass, calculated byhxi. The center of mass remains still
in the initial site during BO, while oscillates around the initial
site in the quadratic GBO, as indicated by the dotted lines in
figures 1(a) and 1(b).
More importantly, the integrated spectrumρ
(
ω
)
presents
more significant difference between BO and the quadratic
GBO, as compared in figures 1(c) and 1(d). In both figures,
we plotρ
(
ω
)
aroundω
B
, and it can be seen that in the spec-
trum of BO, only a single frequency peak arises located at
ω
B
, while in the spectrum of the quadratic GBO, a series of
peaks arise, of which the spacings between neighbor peaks
are the same. The neighbor spacings take exactly the value
δω=2π
2
V
2
/~k
2
as derived in Eq. (3). The equidistant fre-
quency splitting in the presence of the quadratic term is one
major result of this work.
In order to further verify the equidistant behavior in the
spectrum of the quadratic GBO, we numerically calculate the
neighbor spacings over a relatively wide range ofV
2
, and
compare the results to the analytical value ofδω, as shown
in figure 2. In figure 2, the neighbor spacings between the
central four peaks in the spectrum are plotted as a function of
V
2
, together with the analytical value ofδω. It is clearly seen
from figure 2 that all the spacings are lying on top of each and
match well withδω. Figure 2 verifies the equidistant behavior
in the spectrum of the quadratic GBO, and confirms the poten-
tial use of the quadratic GBO for thein-situmeasurement of
the quadratic external potentials.
2.  Effects of higher order gradients
In this section we numerically simulate the GBO under the
external potentials, which are composed of gradients of arbi-
trarily high orders. The external potential of the general form
can model complicated forces, such as the van der Waals and
the Casimir-Polder forces. We then take the Casimir force as

an example to demonstrate the GBO in the presence of higher
order gradients, and the corresponding potential is taken as the
thermal Casimir-Polder plus the gravity potentialMgx, which
models the interaction between atom and the dielectric surface
in the presence of the gravity field. The linear gravity field is
much stronger than the Casimir-Polder potential, which guar-
antees the linear gradient dominant in the external potential,
as required in the analytical derivation.
The choice of parameters in the numerical simulations fol-
lows that in works [39, 40], which corresponds to the specific

the 13-th site of a lattice with spatial period 873nm, of which
the local minimum is around 5.7μm. The results with lattice
heights 8E

are shown in figure 3. Figures 3(a)
and (b) present the temporal density oscillation and the den-
sity spectrum in a lattice of height 8E

. In the density oscil-
lation, a periodic oscillatory behavior is observed, and more
importantly, a fine structure composed of roughly four peaks
arises in the spectrum. A qualitative agreement between the
numerically calculated spectrum and the analytical prediction
by the first-order perturbation treatment indicates that the lo-
cations of the frequency peaks are linearly dependent on the
strength of the Casimir-Polder potential, which guarantees a
potential use of the GBO spectrum for measuring the strength
of the thermal force. Increasing the lattice barrier to 12E
R
, the
density oscillation shrinks to fewer sites, as shown in figure
3(c), and the corresponding spectrum in figure 3(d) is also re-

duced to fewer peaks, which reveals the relation between the
spannings in the real space and in the spectrum. Figure 3, in
general, indicates that the spectrum of the GBO with carefully
chosen lattice parameters can present fine structures, which
encodes the detailed information of the external force.
It is worth pointing out that, the standard BO has been pro-
posed [39] for measuring the linear component of the Casimir-
Polder potential, with ultracold lattice atoms subjected to both
the gravity and the Casimir force. The proposal assumed that
under the condition that the Casimir force is much weaker
than the gravity force, the effect of the Casimir force to the
spectrum of the BO is merely the shift of the prime frequency
by the linear component of the Casimir force, and the shift can
be used to measure the strength of the linear component and
consequently the Casimir force. Our simulation, however, in-
dicates that the Casimir force, even though much weaker than
the linear gravity force, can bring in fine structures to the spec-
trum. Under a limited spectrum resolution in experiments, the
fine structure could be seen a broadening of the prime fre-
quency, of which the width is around 10
−4
ω
B
. Then in this
case, the fine structure leads to an intrinsic error to the pro-
posal. On the other hand, in the case that the fine structure
can be resolved in experiments with improved resolution of
the measured spectrum, it can be used to decode more infor-
mation of the external force. For instance, the ratio between
the spacings of the peaks in the fine structure can work as
a fingerprint of the external potentials, and be used to distin-
guish one type of potential to another. The exact value of these
peaks could further determine the strength of the potential.
III.  DISCUSSION
In this work, we have theoretically investigated the gener-
alized Bloch oscillations (GBOs) of non-interacting ultracold
atoms in optical lattices in the presence of external potentials
with higher order gradients. The results demonstrate that the
spectrum of GBO presents fine structures of multiple series
of frequency peaks, which encodes the properties, such as the
strength of different gradients, of the external potential. With
the fast progress of the experimental techniques, the fine struc-
ture could be within the reach of experiments in the recent
future.
The fine structure gives rise to a two-fold consequence to

6
the application of using the BO (or GBO) for measuring the
external force. For one thing, in the case of a limited resolu-
tion of the experimentally measured spectrum, the fine struc-
tures could manifest as a broadening of the Bloch frequencies,
and brings in errors to the measured results. For another, ifthe
fine structure could be resolved in experiments, it could sup-
ply more information than that given by BO. The spectrum
of BO or approximated BO can only tell the strength of the
linear gradient of the external potentials, while the fine struc-
ture could be used as a fingerprint to identify the type of ex-
ternal potential. The GBO under higher order gradients then
possesses the potential use of the lattice atoms tunneling for
measuring not only the linear, but the higher order gradients,
which offers new possibilities to measure complicated forces
with ultracold atom ensembles [31–43].

Appendix A: THE ANALYTIC DERIVATION OF
EQUIDISTANT SPLITTING IN SPECTRUM MAP
In the appendix, we derive the dependence of the char-
acteristic peaks in the spectrum of GBO, by applying per-
turbation treatments to the Wannier-Stark states.  Since the
GBO only spans over a few sites around the initial one, in
which the atoms are initially loaded to, we can adapt the tight-
binding Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian to describe the system,

We study the laser control of magnon topological phases induced by the Aharonov-Casher effect
in  insulating  antiferromagnets  (AFs).   Since  the  laser  electric  field  can  be  considered  as  a  time-
periodic perturbation,  we apply the Floquet theory and perform the inverse frequency expansion
by  focusing  on  the  high  frequency  region.   Using  the  obtained  effective  Floquet  Hamiltonian,  we
study nonequilibrium magnon dynamics away from the adiabatic limit and its effect on topological
phenomena.  We show that a linearly polarized laser can generate helical edge magnon states and
induce the magnonic spin Nernst effect, whereas a circularly polarized laser can generate chiral edge
magnon states and induce the magnonic thermal Hall effect.  In particular,  in the latter,  we find
that the direction of the magnon chiral edge modes and the resulting thermal Hall effect can be
controlled by the chirality of the circularly polarized laser through the change from the left-circular
to the right-circular polarization.  Our results thus provide a handle to control and design magnon
topological properties in the insulating AF.
I.    INTRODUCTION
The utilization of the quantized spin wave, magnons,
plays   an   increasingly   important   role   in   spintron-
ics,   spawning  its  subfield,   magnon-spintronics  a.k.a.
magnonics  [1,  2].   The  main  subject  in  this  field  is  the
realization  of  rapid  and  efficient  transmission  of  infor-
mation  through  spins.   For  this  purpose,  antiferromag-
nets  (AFs)  [3–5]  have  an  advantage  over  ferromagnets
(FMs) [6–8] in that the dynamics is much faster in the
former since the former energy scale arising from micro-
scopic  and  quantum-mechanical  spin  exchange  interac-
tions is much larger than the latter energy scale governed
by the macroscopic magnetic dipole interaction.
Another important viewpoint is the error-tolerance of
communication,  and  topology  is  a  useful  tool  to  real-
ize  the  states  robust  against  impurities.   In  Ref.  [9],  a
magnonic topological insulator (TI) is realized in the AF
with the electric field gradient making use of the opposite
magnon chirality [10–12] associated with the N ́eel mag-
netic order.  This gradient field behaves as the gauge po-
tential for magnons through the Aharonov-Casher (AC)
effect [13] and forms the Landau level of magnons in the
bulk.  In particular, magnons with the opposite magnon
chirality  carrying  a  magnetic  dipole  momentσgμ

is the Bohr magneton andgis
theg-factor of the constituent spins, propagate along the
edge of the sample in the opposite direction and thus the
helical edge modes are realized in AFs, being in contrast
to the chiral edge mode in FMs [14] characterized by the
single magnon chirality.  The spin transport properties in
such AFs have a topological nature and cannot be dis-
turbed by local perturbations.  Thus the next task is to
elucidate  how  to  manipulate  the  topology  in  magnonic
TIs.
A conventional way to change the physical state is tun-
ing the control parameters of the system, e.g., tempera-

ture, pressure, and a static electromagnetic field.  How-
ever  a  remarkable  advance  in  the  field  of  quantum  op-
tics  offers  a  novel  method  to  the  manipulation  of  the
state;  the  application  of  laser.    A  number  of  studies
have been conducted both theoretically and experimen-
tally on the laser-induced or -controlled states such as the
photoinduced metal-insulator transition [15, 16], Floquet
topological  phases  [17–21],  and  laser-induced  magnetic
states [22–26].  In particular,  for magnetic systems,  the
typical energy scale is on the order of meV, which corre-
sponds to the terahertz frequency.  Thus spin manipula-
tion is performed in the picosecond time interval and it is
much faster than the time scale of conventional spintron-
ics.  Therefore establishing the way to control magnonic
TIs [9] is an essential ingredient for the ultrafast topo-

logical magnonics.
In  this  paper,  we  consider  the  application  of  a  laser
to  the  insulating  AF  on  the  square  lattice  with  an
easy-axis  magnetic  anisotropy  which  hosts  two  kinds
of gapped magnons with the same parabolic dispersion
and  the  opposite  magnetic  dipole  moment  [9].   At  low
temperature  [27],  interaction  effects  such  as  magnon-
magnon  and  magnon-phonon  interactions  become  neg-
ligibly small [28–30].  We treat the effect of the laser as
a time-periodic electric field, which is incorporated into
the Hamiltonian as the time-periodic AC potential.  This
system  can  be  analyzed  by  the  Floquet  theory  and  in
the  high  frequency  regime,  we  can  obtain  the  effective
Floquet Hamiltonian [19, 31] by the high frequency ex-
pansion.  We find that the linearly polarized laser with
nonzero time-averaged field induces helical magnon edge
states, while the circularly polarized laser induces a pair
of chiral magnon edge states (Fig. 1).  The laser response
depending  on  the  direction  of  the  magnetic  dipole  mo-
ment for each magnon plays an important role.  In an-
other perspective, our study corresponds to the further
extension of Ref. [9] into the nonequilibrium regime away
from the adiabatic limit.  The resulting difference in the
thermomagnetic  properties  [32–38]  of  Hall  transport  is
also discussed.
This  paper  is  organized  as  follows.    In  Sec.  II,  we
quickly review the magnonic TI in the static situation. In
Sec.  III, considering three types of lasers, we derive each
effective Floquet Hamiltonian and find the difference in
the magnon motion focusing on theσ-dependence.  The
resulting difference in thermomagnetic properties of Hall
transport is discussed in Sec.  IV. In Sec.  V, we provide a
theoretical insight into experiments.  Finally, we remark
on several issues in Sec.  VI and summarize in Sec.  VII.
Technical details are described in the Appendix.
II.    MAGNONIC TI
Before  considering  the  laser  application,  we  quickly
review  the  magnonic  TI  realized  in  the  insulating  AFs
with the static electric field gradient.  For the details, see
Ref. [9].  The contents in this section are the basis for our
study on the case of time-dependent electric field instead
of the static field, which is discussed in the following sec-
tions.
It has been established that the spin-wave theory [39,
40]  and  its  quantized  version,  the  magnon  picture  [41],
well  describes  the  thermomagnetic  properties  such  as
magnetization  and  specific  heat  in  the  AFs  [42,  43]  as
well as FMs.  We consider the insulating AF on a two-
dimensional square lattice residing in thexyplane with
magnetic anisotropy that prefers theS
z
axis. The ground
state  of  this  system  has  the  N ́eel  order  along  thezdi-
rection  and  the  low  energy  excitation  structure  is  dic-
tated in terms of as electrically neutral bosonic quasipar-
ticles  after  the  Bogoliubov  transformation.   Here  there
exist two kinds of bosons carrying a magnetic dipole mo-
mentσgμ
B
e
z
withσ≡δS
z
=  1(−1),  which  are  re-
spectively  identified  with  up  (down)  magnons.   Due  to
the presence of easy-axis magnetic anisotropy, the insu-
lating AFs have gapped and parabolic dispersion under
the long wave-length approximation,  and the dynamics
can  be  described  by  using  the  decoupled  two  magnon
modes (σ=±1) at temperature lower than the magnon
gap.  In the low-energy regime, such an antiferromagnetic
magnonic  system  effectively  preserves  the  time-reversal
symmetry (TRS).
In Ref. [9],  under the assumption that the total spin
along thezaxis
∑
j
S

is conserved and remains a good
quantum  number,  we  have  proposed  a  magnonic  ana-
log of the quantum spin Hall effect characterized by he-
lical  edge  states  and  thus  established  a  bosonic  coun-
terpart of TIs [44, 45], namely the magnonic TIs in in-
sulating AFs using the above-mentioned picture for the
clean systems and following the work by Aharonov and
Casher  [13,  46].    The  proposal  is  built  upon  the  fact
that an electric field couples to the magnetic dipole mo-
mentσgμ

through  the  AC  effect  [13,  47–55],  which
is analogous to the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect [56–58]
of electrically charged particles in magnetic fields.  Each
magnon  (σ=±1)  of  the  insulating  AF  subjected  to
a  dc  electric  field  withEa  constant  gradientE(r)  =
E(−x,0,0)  as  a  function  of  the  positionr=  (x,y,0)

duced by easy-axis spin anisotropy.  See Ref. [9] for the

of  up  and  down
magnons  associated  with  the  N ́eel  order  in  insulating
AFs.   Thisσ-dependence  is  the  key  ingredient  [10–12]
for  qualitatively  new  phenomena  in  AFs  which  are  not
found in FMs [14] such as the violation of the magnonic
Wiedemann-Franz  (WF)  law  for  Hall  transport  [9,  14]
and  the  generation  of  helical  edge  magnon  states.   Ex-
periencing the AC vector potentialA

rection,  leading  to  the  helical  edge  magnon  state  [59].
Note that the TRS as well as the total spin conservation
along thezaxis protect the topological phase and heli-
cal edge states against nonmagnetic impurities.  The key
ingredient for the generation of topological edge states is
the cyclotron motion in the bulk of the system where up
and down magnons are decoupled.

It has been established theoretically that magnonic TIs
are  realized  in  the  gradient  dc  electric  field.   However,
whether those states remain intact or not in nonequilib-
rium, in other words, whether those topological proper-
ties  are  robust  against  time-dependent  perturbation,  is
still an open issue and the scope of this paper.
III.    MAGNON MOTION IN LASER
Applying  the  laser  with  a  frequency  Ω  (a  period
T=  2π/Ω)  to  the  insulating  AF  described  by  Eq.  (1),
magnons of opposite spins (σ=±1) subjected to a peri-
odic electric fieldE(t) =E(t+T) acquire the AC vector
potential [13, 14, 49],

and the Hamiltonian Eq. (1) also becomes time-periodic

magnon (σ=±1) is specifically written as

2
+ ∆.(3)
and  the  total  Hamiltonian  of  the  system  is  given  as
∑
σ
H
σ
(t). Assuming that the system experiences a time-
evolution away from the adiabatic limit with the applica-
tion of high frequency laser Ωω
c
, the magnon motion
is described by the effective Floquet Hamiltonian [31] of
Eq. (3), which is represented asH

tively (1/Ω

of the high fre-
quency expansion (see Appendix  for details).
We  remark  that  though  the  magnetic  field  is  accom-
panied  by  the  laser  electric  field,  it  does  not  couple  to
the  orbital  motion  of  magnons,  i.e.,  the  linear  momen-
tum of magnons but enters the magnon energy directly
through  the  Zeeman  coupling  without  affecting  orbital
motion.    After  time-averaging,  the  effect  of  the  time-
varying  magnetic  field  on  the  magnon  energy  can  be
captured  by  renormalizing  the  energy  gap  of  magnons,
and  up  and  down  magnons  are  still  degenerate  due  to
the easy-axis spin anisotropy and the resultant magnon
energy  gap  [60].   On  the  contrary,  an  electric  field  af-
fects the orbital motion of magnons via AC effects and
thereby can induce the finite Berry phases for magnons
as  studied  in  Refs.  [9,  14].   Thus  we  study  the  effects
of the coupling of an ac electric field of laser to orbital
motion  of  magnons  on  the  magnon  bands,  looking  for
possible laser-induced topological phases of magnons.  In
this paper, our consideration is restricted to the magnon
dynamics  in  the  high  frequency  region  Ωω
c
,  where
the Floquet Hamiltonian [31] of Eq. (3) can be analyzed
through the high-frequency expansion.
A.    Linearly polarized laser
First let us consider the case of linearly polarized laser
providing  the  electric  fieldE(t)  =E(−xcos(Ωt),0,0).
This gives rise to the periodic AC vector potential

the  time  averaged  value  is  zero

The  cancellation  of  theH

term  reflects  the  time-
reversal invarianceA
m

(−t).  From Eq. (5), we
find  that  the  effective  magnon  mass  is  renormalized  as
for the motion along theydirection and the confinement
by the harmonic potential happens along thexdirection,
and both effects are irrelevant with topological properties
of magnons.  Since there are no terms coupling momen-
tum and spatial coordinates such asp
y
xandp
x
ywhich
play the role of the Lorentz force [61] for magnons, the
Landau energy level [9, 14] is not formed and magnons
do not perform the cyclotron motion, leading to the ab-
sence of  any magnon  edge states  in  the high frequency
region. Therefore the linearly polarized laser Eq. (4) does
not  bring  any  topological  properties  to  magnon  trans-
port  in  the  insulating  AFs;  the  absence  of  any  edge
magnon states and the topologically trivial bulk without
any magnon Hall effects [9, 14, 49].
B.    Linearly polarized laser with nonzero
time-averaged field
In this section we consider another type of linearly po-
larized  laserE(t)  =E(−xcos

(Ωt),0,0).   The  resulting
periodic AC vector potential is given by

.    Here  the  harmonic  potential
term is dropped since it is irrelevant to topological prop-
erties  of  magnons.   Due  to  the  emergence  of  the  effec-
tive electric field gradientE
eff
, magnons of opposite spins
(σ=±1) form the same Landau energy level and per-
form the cyclotron motion [9, 14] with the same frequency
and the same electric length but in the opposite direction
depending onσas is seen from Eq. (7), which leads to
helical edge magnon states.
Note that the total spin conservation and the TRS still
holds in the present setup.  There symmetries protect the
topological phase and helical edge states against nonmag-
netic impurities [62].
C.    Circularly polarized laser
Next  we  move  on  to  the  case  of  circularly  polarized
laser  [17,  63,  64].    The  laser  electric  field  isE(t)  =
E(−xcos(Ωt),ηxsin(Ωt),0), whereη= 1(−1) is the index
to represent the left (right) circular polarization.  Then
the periodic AC vector potential becomes
A
m

Secs.  III A and III B. Again we obtain an effective Flo-

Contrary  to  Secs.   III A  and  III B,  since  the  circularly

and  brings  the  term  proportional  top
y
x[Eq.  (10b)]
that  works  as  a  Lorentz  force  for  magnons  [9,  14,  49],
namely,  the laser-induced Lorentz force proportional to
1/Ω.  Note that the force does not depend on the index
σ=±1 for up and down magnons, while it depends on
the indexη= 1(−1) for the left (right) circular polariza-
tion of the laser.  Therefore both up and down magnons
perform the cyclotron motion in the same direction de-
pending  on  the  signη,  differently  from  the  case  of  the
linearly polarized laser in Sec. III B. In other words, the
direction  of  the  cyclotron  motion  can  be  controlled  by
tuning the chirality of the circularly polarized laser.
To conclude, in the circularly polarized laser magnons
acquire the laser-induced effective electric field gradient
E
eff
∝1/Ω.   Thereby  forming  the  same  Landau  energy
level,  magnons of opposite spins (σ=±1) perform the
cyclotron motion along the same direction, leading to the
chiral edge magnon states.  The direction of the cyclotron
motion  and  that  of  the  resulting  chiral  edge  magnons
can  be  controlled  by  changing  the  chirality  of  the  cir-
cularly  polarized  laser  between  the  left-circular  or  the
right-circular polarization (η=±1) as can be seen from
Eqs. (11a) and (11b), which are the main results of this
paper.   The  schematic  figure  of  the  present  setup  and
induced chiral magnon edge modes is shown in Fig. 1.
Since  the  effective  gradient  electric  field  [Eq.  (11b)]
induced by circularly polarized laser vanishes in the high
frequency limit Ω→∞, it is interpreted as an ‘emergent’
field having an intrinsically nonequilibrium nature away
from the adiabatic limit Ω→0.
D.    Laser-driven magnon and symmetry
In the high frequency regime Ωω
c
the linearly po-
larized laser [Eq.  (6)] can induce the helical edge magnon
states, while the circularly polarized laser [Eq.  (9)] can
generate the chiral edge magnon states whose direction
can be controlled by changing the chirality of the laser,
i.e., depending on the indexη= 1(−1) for the left (right)
circular [Eq.  (11a)].  Those insulating AFs in laser be-
come  topologically  nontrivial.   Thus  depending  on  the
form of the laser, e.g., polarized linearly or circularly, the
details of the edges states (i.e.,  chiral or helical) in the
topological AFs vary from system to system.  This indi-
cates that by tuning the laser, we can control and design
topological properties of antiferromagnetic magnonic sys-
tems.
We remark that sinceA
m

m

polarized laser, those systems described by the Hamilto-
nianH

quet HamiltonianH

possess the TRS.
The TRS of the system can be seen by the transforma-
tionp→ −pandσ→ −σ.   On  the  other  hand,  since
A

(−t) for the circularly polarized laser,  the
TRS  is  broken  in  the  system  described  by  the  Hamil-

[Eq. (11a)].  This TRS

IV.    HALL TRANSPORT WITH THE
APPLICATION OF LASER
In  this  section,  we  discuss  the  laser-induced  thermo-
magnetic properties of Hall transport in the topological
AFs.   Within  the  linear  response  regime,  the  spin  and
heat  Hall  current  densities  for  each  mode  (σ=±1)  in
the  topological  AFs  subjected  to  an  effective  magnetic
field gradient (i.e., a gradient of nonequilibrium magnon
chemical potential [65]) and a temperature gradient are
described by the Onsager matrix of Eq. (31) in Ref. [9].
Within the almost flat band approximation [9, 14, 66, 67],
the  Onsager  coefficients  become  characterized  by  the
topological invariant (i.e., Chern integer) that edge states
bring about.
Since  the  linearly  polarized  laser  [Eq.  (6)]  can  in-
duce helical edge magnon states,  the total Chern num-
ber vanishes, while theZ
2
topological invariant becomes
nonzero [9].  Therefore the diagonal elements of the On-
sager matrix vanishes, whereas the off-diagonal elements
becomes  nonzero.   This  leads  to  the  generation  of  the
magnonic spin Nernst effect, while the vanishment of the
magnonic  thermal  Hall  effect.   The  vanishment  of  the
magnonic spin Hall conductanceG
yx
AF
= 0 and the ther-
mal Hall conductanceK
yx
AF
= 0 in the AFs indicate that
the thermomagnetic ratioK
yx
AF
/G
yx
AF
becomes ill-defined
due toG
yx
AF
= 0 and that the WF law [14, 28, 68] char-
acterized by the liner-in-Tbehavior at low temperature
becomes violated due toK
yx
AF
= 0 [9].
On the other hand, since the circularly polarized laser
[Eq. (9)] can induce chiral edge magnon states [14] the
Z
2
topological  invariant  [9]  vanishes,  while  the  total
Chern  number  becomes  nonzero.   Therefore  the  diago-
nal elements of the Onsager matrix [9] becomes nonzero,
whereas  the  off-diagonal  elements  vanishes.   This  leads
to  the  generation  of  the  magnonic  thermal  Hall  effect,
while  the  vanishment  of  the  magnonic  spin  Nernst  ef-
fect.   The  direction  of  the  thermal  Hall  current  can  be
controlled by switching the chirality of the laser between
the left-circular and right-circular polarization (η=±1)
[Eq. (11a)] as shown in Fig. 1.  The thermomagnetic ratio
satisfies the magnonic WF law [14] at low temperature
[27],

as  the  topological  FM  [14]  does  satisfy.   Note  that  the
thermal  Hall  effect  of  magnons  has  been  observed  in
Ref. [69] and the measurement of a magnonic spin con-
ductance has been reported in Ref. [70] where the gradi-
ent of a nonequilibrium magnonic spin chemical poten-
tial  [65,  71–75]  plays  the  role  of  an  effective  magnetic
field  gradient.   Thereby  we  expect  that  the  magnonic
WF  law  [9,  14,  28]  can  be  experimentally  confirmed
[55, 69, 70, 76–85].
To  conclude,  depending  on  the  form  of  laser  such  as
linear or circular polarization, the thermomagnetic prop-
erties of Hall transport (e.g., the magnonic WF law) in
insulating AFs vary from system to system.  This indi-
cates that by tuning the laser, we can control and design
thermomagnetic  Hall  transport  properties  in  antiferro-
magnetic magnonic systems.  Those results for the laser-
induced  magnon  motion  and  Hall  transport  properties
are summarized in Table I.

V.    ESTIMATE FOR EXPERIMENTS
The development of laser techniques [86–88] in quan-
tum  optics  [89]  is  remarkably  rapid.The  advanced
laser technologies such as optical tweezers [90], plasmon-
ics [86, 87], near-field [87], and metamaterials [91] enable
us to realize the various profile of electric and magnetic
fields including an ac electric field gradient we considered
in this work.
The thermal Hall effect of magnons has been observed
in Ref. [69] and experimental evidence for the magnonic
spin   Nernst   effect   has   been   reported   in   Ref.   [80].
Therefore making use of those measurement techniques,
our  theoretical  predictions  (Table  I),  i.e.,  laser-induced
magnonic topological phases, can be experimentally con-
firmed  by  measuring  Hall  currents.As  seen  in  Sec.
IV, the linearly polarized laser can generate helical edge
magnon states and induce the magnonic spin Nernst ef-
fect, while the circularly polarized laser can generate chi-
ral edge magnon states and induce the magnonic thermal
Hall  effect  (Table  I).  Thereby  measuring  Hall  currents
instead  of  directly  observing  edge  magnon  states  [92],
our  theoretical  predictions  can  be  experimentally  con-
firmed [93].
We  estimate  the  experimental  feasibility  with  taking
Cr
2
O
3
[94, 95] for example following Ref. [9].  This ma-
terial  has  the  spin  quantum  numberS=  3/2,g-factor
g=  2,  the  lattice  constanta=  0.5  nm,  the  easy-
axis  anisotropyK=  0.03  meV,  and  the  antiferromag-
netic nearest-neighbor spin exchange interactionJ= 15
meV.  The  magnon  gap  arising  from  the  easy-axis  spin
anisotropy  amounts  to  ∆  =  4  meV  and  the  frequency
of cyclotron motions becomesω
c
=O(1) GHz.  Thereby
using a picosecond laser [96] Ω =O(1) THz and the ex-
perimental scheme proposed in Refs. [9, 14],  we expect
that the laser-induced magnonic topological phases can
be realized experimentally in the low temperature regime
[27, 97].
Lastly, we comment on the heating effect by laser appli-
cation. In this paper, we focus on the magnetic insulators
with large electronic band gap. Hence electric excitations
by the laser electric field are negligible and consequently,
the heating through the electron-phonon coupling (e.g.,
Joule heating) is negligibly small.  Thus we only have to
consider the heating problem of the isolated quantum sys-
tem.  From Ref. [98], the energy-absorption ratePof the
isolated quantum system subjected to periodic driving at
the frequency Ω is bounded asP≤~ω
2
c
exp(−Ω/ω
c
).  It
is  exponentially  small  in  the  high  frequency  regime  we
considered above.  The estimation is given as Ω/ω
c
∼10
3
with the parametersω
c
=O(1) GHz and Ω =O(1) THz.
Therefore, we conclude that heating effects are irrelevant
in our systems.
VI.    DISCUSSION
Before concluding, we make further discussions on sev-
eral points of this paper and the future problems.  First,
the  mechanism  of  our  laser-induced  magnonic  topolog-
ical  phases  discussed  in  Sec.  III B  is  different  [99]  from
that of the so-called Floquet TIs [100, 101] in the sense
that we do not employ Dirac materials [17, 63, 64] with a
relativistic spectrum (i.e., a linear dispersion) or ac filed-
driven  resonance  across  the  band  gap  [20,  21].   We  re-
mark that Dirac magnons having a linear dispersion are
available  on  two-dimensional  honeycomb  lattices  [102].
In Ref. [14], we have studied those Dirac magnons in the
AC effect.  The correspondence between Dirac magnons
in  the  AC  effect  and  Dirac  electrons  in  the  AB  effect
[63,  64]  is  straightforward.   For  example,  by  simply  re-
placing the Fermi velocity,  electric charge,  and the AB
vector potential [56] with the magnon velocity,gμ
B
, and
A
m
,  respectively,  one  can  map  the  equation  for  Dirac
electrons in the AB effect to that for Dirac magnons in
the  AC  effect.   Compare  Eq.   (1)  of  Ref.  [63]  with  Eq.
(D1) of Ref. [14].  Therefore by applying this mapping to
Floquet TIs established in Dirac electron systems [63, 64],
the magnonic analog of the Floquet TIs can be derived
theoretically [103–106].  Moreover, while it is outside the
scope of this work since we focus on the magnon dynamics
away from the adiabatic limit Ωω
c
, the laser-induced
resonance across the Landau energy gap of magnons is
expected to be generated, in the same way as the ac field-
driven resonance across the band gap [20, 21], by tuning
the laser frequency to the cyclotron frequency of magnons
Ω≈ω
c
, which we leave for the further study [99].
Second,wecommentontheeffectofthe
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya    interaction    (DMI)    [107–109].
When   the   inversion   symmetry   is   broken,   a   time-
independent DMI indeed can exist and work as a vector
potential [110] for magnons in the similar way as the AC
phaseA
m
induced by electric field gradient.  However, a
spatially uniform DMI does not give rise to any emergent
electromagnetic  field  that  acts  as  the  Lorentz  force  on
magnons  and  thus  should  not  change  the  qualitative
behavior  of  magnons  obtained  in  our  work.   We  thus
conclude that our results, topological phenomena associ-
ated with the Landau quantization of Floquet magnons,
qualitatively remain unchanged even in the presence of
such DMI. Those topological phenomena are stable even
with the Rashba-like splitting of the bands provoked by
the  DMI,  which  retains  TRS.  Since  the  possible  type
of  DMI  strongly  depends  on  the  details  of  the  system,
e.g., the lattice geometry and the magnetic point group,
the comprehensive study on the effects caused by DMI
is  beyond  the  scope  of  the  present  paper.   The  effect
from the interplay of DMI and magnon chirality in AFs
has  been  investigated  including  the  optical  excitations
such  as  magnon  photocurrents  [10–12].   Those  results
are helpful for our future study.
Third,  a  general  treatment  of  nonequilibrium-driven
topological phases in AFs beyond our theoretical frame-

7
work  [111]  remains  an  open  problem  such  as  disorder
effects  due  to  magnetic  impurities  or  the  effects  of  hy-
bridization of spin-up and spin-down magnons due to the
symmetry/conservation breaking terms.  While we treat
the steady state in terms of the Floquet theory in this pa-
per, considering the transient dynamics, thermalization,
and open systems [98, 112] in the laser application is an
interesting future problem.
Last, applying a laser to magnets is just one of the ways
to drive magnets into nonequilibrium.  We envision that
subjecting magnetic systems to various types of nonequi-
librium driving, e.g., time-varying thermal environment
or charge/heat currents, can be versatile means to realize
novel topological phases in magnetic systems.
VII.    SUMMARY
Let us summarize our results.  Assuming that the to-
tal  spin  along  thezaxis  is  conserved,  we  have  estab-
lished  the  laser  control  of  magnonic  topological  phases
in the AF by making use of the AC effect on magnons
in  laser.   Using  the  Floquet  formalism,  we  have  found
in the high frequency regime that the linearly polarized
laser  can  generate  helical  edge  magnon  states  and  in-
duce the magnonic spin Nernst effect, while the circularly
polarized  laser  can  generate  chiral  edge  magnon  states
and induce the magnonic thermal Hall effect.  We have
thus provided a handle to control and design topological
properties of the  insulating AF. Our result  for control-
ling magnonic topological phases by laser provides a new
direction  for  development  of  magnonics,  and  will  serve
as a bridge between two research areas, magnonics and
quantum optics.

Appendix: Floquet formalism
In this Appendix, for completeness, we provide details
of the straightforward calculation of the effective Floquet
Hamiltonian.   For  a  general  framework  of  the  Floquet
formalism, see the review article Ref. [31].

First  let  us  explain  the  derivation  of  the  Floquet  ef-

[59]  The  force  acting  on  magnons  in  the  dc  electric  field
[Eq. (1)] is invariant under a gauge transformation [9]
and  the  gauge  invariance  is  specific  to  only  magnons,
i.e. electrically neutral particles.
[60]  The magnon gap due to the easy-axis spin anisotropy
amounts to ∆ = 4 meV for [94, 95] Cr

O

, see Ref. [9]
for  details  of  experiment  parameter  values.Compared
with  it,  the  magnetic  energy  due  to  the  resulting  ac
magnetic  field  from  the  applied  laser  (i.e.,  ac  electric
field),e.g., picosecond laser [96] Ω =O(1) THz, is neg-
ligibly small. Furthermore, the magnetic energy can be
substantially softened by allowing for a periodic exten-
sion of linear electric field gradients [9, 14].
[61]  See  Eq.  (14)  in  Ref.  [9]  for  the  details  of  the  Lorentz
force [49] for magnons in the AC vector potential.

(Dated:  July 16, 2019)
In a recent paper [I. Brevik, Phys. Rev. A98, 043847 (2018)], Brevik analyzed the experiment by
Kunduet al.[A. Kunduet al., Sci. Rep.7, 42538 (2017)] reporting deformation of a graphene oxide
(GO) film after it has been irradiated by a laser beam.  The two-dimensional atomic force microscope
(AFM) line scanning of the deformation of the GO film after switching off the laser beam takes by
far too much time for any elastic changes to remain in the AFM scans.  Thus, the changes in the GO
film are irreversible and the optoelastic model used by Brevik is not applicable.  The rough estimates
of the kinetic energy and displacement of atoms by the optical force of a light pulse calculated by
Brevik are correct, but in making a comparison with the corresponding high-precision results for the
kinetic energy and displacement of atoms in our work [M. Partanenet al., Phys. Rev. A95, 063850
(2017)], the kinetic energy of atoms is confused with their rest energy.  The atoms and their masses
are displaced forward by the field and their displaced rest energies give rise to an energy flux.  The
difference of arguments between ours and Brevik’s culminates on the question whether the flux of
rest energy caused by the displacement of the medium moving with light should be included in the
total energy flux.  We also show that the four-divergence of the stress-energy-momentum tensor of
the mass polariton theory of light is zero.
I.  INTRODUCTION
In  a  recent  paper  [1],  Brevik  analyzed  an  interesting
experiment by Kunduet al.[2], who reported the defor-
mation  of  a  graphene  oxide  (GO)  film  after  irradiating
it with a laser beam.  Kunduet al.concluded that the
observed  deformation  supports  the  Abraham  model  of
the momentum of light.  Brevik also made some critical
observations regarding the mass polariton (MP) theory
of  light  presented  by  Partanenet al.[3].   We  start  by
considering these comments and then, at the end of our
paper, we briefly remark on the experiment of Kunduet
al.and in particular its relation to the model that Brevik
used to calculate the bending of the GO film under the
influence of a laser beam.
II.  CALCULATING THE KINETIC ENERGY OF
ATOMS
On p. 1 of his paper [1],  Brevik claimed that,  in our
work  [3],  we  would  have  predicted  “transfer  of  quite  a
large mechanical energy from the pulse to the medium,
of the same order of magnitude as the field energy itself.”
This claim is unsound.  In Ref. [3], or in follow-up works
[4–6], we have nowhere claimed that a light wave would
be associated with a mechanical energy,  kinetic energy,
or elastic energy, of the same order of magnitude as the
field energy.
On the contrary, on p. 12 of our work [3], we calculated,
for a light pulse having a total field energy of 5 mJ, ki-
netic energy of the medium atoms to be 3.6×10
−16
eV
per photon, which makes 1.2×10
−15
mJ for the whole
light pulse. Thus, our work [3] proved that the kinetic en-
ergy is nonzero, but a vanishingly small part of the field
energy.   This  follows  directly  from  the  classical  expres-
sion of the kinetic energy of atoms in Eq. (25) of Ref. [3]
used  in  the  optoelastic  continuum  dynamics  (OCD)  of
light.  The OCD model is based on combining the elec-
trodynamics of continuous media, elasticity theory, and
Newtonian mechanics.  It can be used to calculate the ki-
netic energy of the medium for an arbitrary light pulse.
However, for all technologically realizable light pulses and
highly transparent materials, the kinetic energy of atoms
remains extremely small in relation to the field energy.
For the OCD simulations, see also the section discussing
how atoms with negligible kinetic energy can carry a mass
with the velocity of light.
In  our  work  [3]  we  have  also  shown  that  the  kinetic
energy of the mass density wave (MDW) part of the MP
is negligibly small in the case of a single photon (see p. 3
and 4 of Ref. [3]).  Since the momentum of the medium
part  of  the  MP  can  at  most  be  of  the  same  order  of
magnitude as the momentum of the photon in vacuum,
the kinetic energy isE

is the
mass of the smallest structural unit in the medium.  For
example,  for~ω= 0.80 eV (λ

0
=

kg, the mass of a single silicon atom, we obtain
E
k
≤1.2×10

eV. The smallness of the kinetic energy
of  the  medium  part  of  the  MP  is  a  direct  consequence
of  the  extremely  small  momentum  to  energy  ratio  of  a
photon as compared to the momentum to kinetic energy
ratio of a particle having a rest mass.  Thus, in our work
[3] we have shown using two independent approaches that
the kinetic energy of atoms in the MDW is a vanishingly
small part of the field energy.

III.  THEORETICAL GEDANKEN
EXPERIMENT
In Eq. (35) of his work [1], Brevik found for an average
momentum  of  atoms  under  the  influence  of  the  optical
force of a light pulse having durationτ, an expression

fractive index, andE×His the Poynting vector, in which

The momentum density obtained by multiplying the mo-
mentum of a single atom in Eq. (1) by the number density
Nagrees with the momentum density of the MDW in the
integrand of Eq. (13) of our work [3].  Brevik arrived at
the same conclusion as we did in our work [3] that the
kinetic energy of atoms is extremely small.
The fundamental property of the MP theory of light
presented  in  Ref.  [3]  is  that  the  optical  force  gives  rise
to the time- and position-dependent displacement of the
medium  atoms  (see,  e.g.,  Figs.  5  and  7  of  Ref.  [3]  and
Figs. 4 and 5 of Ref. [4]).  Brevik also reproduced these
results for his schematic light pulse and obtained the cor-
rect average total displacement of an atom in the medium
upon  a  pulse  of  durationτ,  given  byl=  (∆p/m
0
)τ=

0

atomic velocity.
Would Brevik have continued his theoretical gedanken
experiment  a  step  further,  he  would  have  found  what
we  guess  he  means  by  the  “mechanical”  energy  of  the
same order of magnitude as the field energy.  The total
displaced  volume  of  atoms  in  the  case  of  his  example
pulse is straightforwardly given byV=Al, whereAis

Brevik’s  example,  the  effective  displaced  medium  mass

must be added to the energy flux of the field to obtain the

In  the  STR,  an  atom  moving  under  the  influence  of
the optical force does not only carry its momentum and
kinetic  energy.   When  an  atom  is  moving,  its  mass  is
also  shifted  and  so  is  the  rest  energy  related  to  this
mass.   Thus,  in  timeτ,  a  single  atom  gives  rise  to  the
shift  of  energym

netic energy of all atoms.  This energy density must be
added to the energy density of the field to obtain the to-
tal energy density of the light pulse.  In contrast, in his
theoretical gedanken experiment, Brevik concluded that,
since the kinetic energy of atoms moving with the light
pulse is negligibly small, the total energy density of light
is equal to the energy density of the field alone.
IV.  HOW ATOMS WITH NEGLIGIBLE
KINETIC ENERGY CAN CARRY A MASS WITH
THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT
The fundamental starting point of the OCD model in-
troduced by us in Ref. [3] is that we write the equation
of motion for the medium under the influence of the op-
tical forces associated with the light pulse and the elastic
forces  that  also  become  effective  after  the  optical  force
has displaced the atoms from their equilibrium positions.
Thus, by solving this dynamical equation, we automat-
ically obtain the displacement and velocity fields of the

3
medium elements for an arbitrary light pulse.  The OCD
model  also  reproduces  the  elastic  waves  following  from
the impact of a light pulse [7].
The atomic displacements in the OCD simulation also
lead  to  the  perturbation  of  the  mass  density  of  the
medium.   The  excess  mass  density  obtained  by  solving
Newton’s equation of motion is given by [3]
ρ
MDW
=ρ
a
−ρ
0
,(3)
whereρ
a
is the true perturbed mass density of atoms and
ρ
0
is the atomic mass density in the absence of the light
pulse.  One can show analytically in the case of a plane
wave or by computer simulations using the OCD theory
that  the  volume  integral  of  the  excess  mass  density  of
atoms in Eq. (3) over the light pulse is equal toδMgiven
in Eq. (2), both in the case of the gedanken experiment
by Brevik and in the case of a general light pulse.
Using  the  standard  formula  for  the  momentum  den-
sity  of  atoms  in  the  laboratory  frame,  our  simulations
give, within the numerical accuracy of the computations,
typically seven to eight digits, the equality [3]
ρ
a
v
a
=ρ
MDW
v
l
,(4)
wherev
a
andv
l
are the atomic and light velocity vec-
tors.  On the left-hand side of Eq. (4) we have the large
true atomic density and small atomic velocity, while on
the right-hand side we have the small excess mass density
of atoms, and the large velocity of light in the medium.
Therefore, the equality in Eq. (4) essentially explains how
the small collective motion of atoms forms a MDW that
propagates with the velocity of light in the medium and
carries with itself the excess atomic density of Eq. (3) cor-
responding to the effective massδMin Eq. (2) and also
the related rest energyδMc
2
.  This is in full agreement
with the schematic illustration in Fig. 1.

Note that the integral of the rest energy density of the
atomic MDW in Eq. (7) is equal toδMc
2
, withδMgiven
in Eq. (2).  Thus, Eq. (7) is in agreement with Brevik’s
analysis.  The momentum density of the MDW in Eq. (8)
is also consistent with Brevik’s analysis as it is equal to
Eq. (34) of Ref. [1].
V.  LORENTZ COVARIANCE AND THE MP
SEM TENSOR
In his work [1] on p. 4, Brevik also criticized our work
[3]  by  stating  that,  due  to  the  termδMc
2
,  the  “values
ofE
MP
andp
MP
do  not  allow  one  to  use  the  Lorentz
transformation, as they are not the energy and momen-
tum components of an energy-momentum tensor whose
four-divergence is zero.” However, Brevik provided no ar-
guments to support his claim that the four-divergence of
the SEM tensor of the MP would be nonzero.
We have introduced the SEM tensor of the MP theory
concisely in Appendix B of our work [3].  In this analysis,
we neglect the negligibly small kinetic and elastic energies
of atoms in the laboratory frame.  Thus, in the MDW, we
include only the dominant terms, which are of the first
order in the small atomic velocityv
a
.  These terms are
the MDW rest energy density and the MDW momentum
density  that  are  moving  with  light.   Following  Ref.  [3],
the  total  MP  SEM  tensor  in  the  laboratory  frame  is  a
sum of the SEM tensorT

Including the contributions of both the field and the

Here⊗denotes the outer product andIis the 3×3 unit

the MDW quantities in terms of the field quantities using
Eqs. (7) and (8).
The proof of the zero four-divergence of the MP SEM
tensor in Eq. (10) is straightforward in the general case
by using Maxwell’s equations and the well-known vector

4
calculus  identities.   This  proof  is  presented  in  the  Ap-
pendix.  We conclude that the four-divergence of the MP
SEM tensor is zero, in contrast to what Brevik claimed.
In  the  works  cited  by  Brevik  [9–11],  the  well-known
angular momentum conservation law problem of the con-
ventional  asymmetric  Minkowski  SEM  tensor  has  been
artificially  solved  by  introducing  the  Gordon  metric,
which  depends  on  the  permittivity  and  permeability  of
materials,  and  consequently,  leads  to  artificial  gravita-
tional fields that are not physically true in the sense of
the general theory of relativity.  Therefore,  these works
do  not  solve  the  angular  momentum  conservation  law
problem  of  the  Minkowski  SEM  tensor  in  the  physical
space-time whose metric is only modified by the curva-
ture  of  the  space-time  due  to  true  gravitational  fields.
For a concise summary of the MP SEM tensor and the
Minkowski SEM tensor, we refer to Table I of Ref. [12].
VI.  KUNDUET AL.EXPERIMENT
In the Kunduet al.experiment, the authors carried out
atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of the GO
film and in particular reported the “AFM height image
of GO surface after focused laser irradiation at different
spots for various laser power.” See Fig. 3 of Ref. [2] for
the  AFM  images,  which  are  taken  well  after  the  laser
irradiation.   If  the  changes  were  elastic,  the  bending  of
the  surface  would  not  be  visible  after  the  laser  irradi-
ation  when  the  two-dimensional  AFM  line  scanning  of
the images, requiring mechanical shifting the AFM tip,
was carried out.  We conclude that the elasticity theory
used  by  Brevik  [1]  is  not  applicable  in  the  analysis  of
the irreversible changes observed by Kunduet al.[2].  A
possible explanation of the deformed GO surface is pro-
vided by the low density of the GO film, given byρ= 750
kg/m
3
[13], which suggests a complex material structure,
which  may  have  a  very  low  irradiation  damage  thresh-
old.  The irreversibility of the deformation of the GO film
also means that the interaction of light with the medium
leads  to  changes  in  the  molecular  structure  of  the  ma-
terial.  Therefore, the optical force concepts behind the
Abraham and Minkowski momenta are not enough in the
analysis of this experiment.  Thus, we agree with Brevik,
that the Kunduet al.experiment is unlikely to provide
the experimental resolution of the Abraham-Minkowski
paradox of light.
VII.  CONCLUSION
Brevik has overlooked that the smallness of the kinetic
energy  of  atoms  was  already  calculated  and  well  docu-
mented in our original work [3].  The remaining difference
between the theories of Brevik and ours is that we argue
on the basis of the fundamental principles of the special
theory  of  relativity  and  relativistic  mechanics  that  the
rest energy of the moving medium elements must be in-
cluded in the total energy flux of light. In Brevik’s model,
this mass energy flux is excluded without giving detailed
arguments that would justify it.  We have also shown in
the Appendix that the four-divergence of the MP SEM
tensor is zero. For detailed classical field-theoretical foun-
dations of the MP theory of light, see the follow-up works
[12, 14].  We have finally argued that the GO surface de-
formations observed in the experiment of Kunduet al.[2]
are  irreversible.  Thus,  the  deformation cannot  be  ana-
lyzed by elasticity theory and conventional optical forces
concepts, which do not account for breaking of chemical
bonds, as done in the work of Brevik.
Appendix A: Four-divergence of the MP SEM tensor
Here we present a proof of the zero four-divergence of
the MP SEM tensor in the laboratory frame of a nondis-
persive lossless medium.  We use the well-known consti-
tutive relationsD=εEandB=μH, in whichεandμ
are the permittivity and permeability of the medium that
are assumed to be constant in a homogeneous isotropic
medium.  Then, the four-divergence of the first row vec-
tor  of  the  MP  SEM  tensor  in  the  laboratory  frame  in
Eq. (10) can be written as

In the first equality, we have taken the constant factors
outside  the  derivatives  and  applied  the  product  rule  of

terms.  In the second equality, we have used Gauss’s laws

∇A

=A×(∇×A) + (A·∇)Afor the fifth and eighth

2
/c

for
the refractive index to obtain the final result, where the
first  and  fourth  terms  and  the  second  and  third  terms
have  canceled  each  other.   Thus,  we  have  shown  that
the four-divergences of the MP SEM tensor row vectors
below the first row vector are zero.
Equations  (A1)  and  (A2)  together  indicate  that  the
four-divergence of the MP SEM tensor is zero.  The zero
four-divergence in an arbitrary inertial frame is a direct
consequence of the zero four-divergence in the laboratory
frame  since  the  MP  SEM  tensor  transforms  according
to  the  Lorentz  transformation  as  described  in  detail  in
Ref. [12].

Signatures of quantum transport are expected to quickly vanish as dissipation is introduced in
a  system.   This  dissipation  can  take  several  forms,  including  that  of  particle  loss,  which  has  the
consequence that the total probability current is not conserved.  Here, we study the effect of such
losses at a quantum point contact (QPC) for ultracold atoms. Experimentally, dissipation is provided
by a near-resonant optical tweezer whose power and detuning control the loss rates for the different
internal atomic states as well as their effective Zeeman shifts.  We theoretically model this situation
by including losses in the Landauer-B ̈uttiker formalism over a wide range of dissipative rates.  We
find good agreement between our measurements and our model, both featuring robust conductance
plateaus.  Finally, we are able to map out the atomic density by varying the position of the near-
resonant tweezer inside the QPC, realizing a dissipative scanning gate microscope for cold atoms.
I.    INTRODUCTION
Coupling a system to its environment is a central con-
cept in physics, giving rise to different types of ensembles
in thermodynamics [1]. It leads to fundamental questions
about the fate of quantum mechanics at a macroscopic
scale  [2,  3].   The  coupling  to  the  environment  can  also
compete with coherence and interaction effects, leading
to new phenomena [4, 5].  A full model of a system and its
environment is out of reach in most cases due to the expo-
nential growth of the total Hilbert space with the number
of degrees of freedom.  Tracing out those of the environ-
ment can be done under certain assumptions leading to
a Lindblad master equation [6].  In some cases,  further
simplification is possible by only adding dissipative terms
to the isolated system’s equation of motion [7, 8].  The
resulting  dynamics,  which  becomes  non-Hermitian,  has
recently found renewed interest due to the exotic behav-
iors  of  exceptional  points  linked  to  the  collapse  of  the
eigenvectors at a critical dissipation strength [9, 10].
Dissipation, understood as the non-conservation of the
system’s volume in phase space over time, is character-
istic  for  transport  phenomena  where  currents  bring  a
system towards equilibrium while producing entropy [1].
There, extrinsic dissipation can be included by physical
or fictitious coupling to a reservoir other than the leads
driving the transport processes.  Such an additional cou-
pling has mostly been studied to model incoherent scat-
tering of electrons [11–13].  It is usually done by adding
a fictitious reservoir with which the lossy region can ex-
change particles without any net current [11].  Mimicking
particle losses as a perturbation to transport by an ad-
ditional absorbing reservoir has to our knowledge so far
not been explored in this context.
Cold clouds of atoms are nearly closed systems by de-
fault,  but can be opened by designing atom losses in a
controlled  way.   Experimental  loss  channels  include  (i)
molecule  formation via  photoassociation [14]  or  via de-
cay to a molecular channel [15–17], (ii) ionization using
a focused electron beam [18, 19] or a femtosecond laser
[20] or (iii) scattering of near-resonant photons that im-
part a large kinetic energy to the atoms [21–23].  Many
of these techniques realize localized losses, an assumption
underlying the usual theoretical models for dissipation in
transport structures [13], realized using an electron beam
in a Bose-Einstein condensate [24, 25].
In this paper, we study dissipation as a perturbation
to transport through a quantum point contact (QPC) for
a  two-component  fermionic  gas  of  ultracold
6
Li  atoms,
where the different hyperfine states of the atoms are in-
terpreted  as  a  pseudo-spin.   The  geometry  of  the  opti-
cal potentials trapping the atoms realizes a two-terminal
transport  setup  as  illustrated  in  Fig  1a  [26].   There,  a
cloud of degenerate fermionic lithium is divided into two
reservoirs  connected  by  a  quasi  one-dimensional  (1D)
constriction  formed  by  two  intersecting  beams  with  a
nodal line.  Controlled by the chemical potential inside
the  1D  channel,  only  one  to  two  transverse  modes  are
available  to  particles  moving  from  one  reservoir  to  the
other.   Since  the  potential  landscape  in  the  channel  is
smooth,  transport  is  ballistic:  the  transmission  proba-
bility  of  the  atoms  is  close  to  unity.   This  leads  to  the
measurement of conductance plateaus [27] as the chemi-
cal potential is increased in the wire, in agreement with
the Landauer-B ̈uttiker model (illustrated in Fig 1b) that
identifies conductance with transmission for mesoscopic
conductors [28–30].
The  losses  are  provided  by  a  near-resonant  beam  fo-
cused  onto  the  constriction.   The  spatial  profile  of  the
beam  is  controlled  holographically  using  a  digital  mi-
cromirror  device,  allowing  us  to  correct  for  aberrations
[31].   The  scattering  rate  and  dipole  potential  experi-
enced by the atoms are related to the imaginary and real
part of the atomic polarizability, respectively, which must
be computed in the regimes of high magnetic fields rel-
evant  for  tuning  the  scattering  properties  of
6
Li.   For
light frequencies close to the atomic resonances of differ-
ent  pseudo-spin  states,  both  scattering  rate  and  dipole
potential  are  strongly  spin-dependent  due  to  the  split-

2
ting  of  their  transition  frequencies.   The  dipole  poten-
tial  can  be  interpreted  as  an  effective  Zeeman  shift  in
the  case  where  its  magnitudes  are  equal  and  opposite
for  both  spins.   This  case  is  investigated  in  our  com-
panion paper [32] wherein the amplitude of this effective
Zeeman shift is on the order of the Fermi energy of the
atoms,  leading  to  a  significant  shift  between  the  onset
of the conductance plateaus of the two spins.  Here, we
focus on the effect of the atom losses engineered for the
atoms.  We demonstrate that in spite of the dissipation,
the conductance plateaus persist owing to the constant
flow  of  low  temperature  particles  through  the  channel.
We  show  that  the  transport  properties  of  a  lossy  QPC
can be described by including the transmission as well as
the  energy-dependent  losses  characterizing  the  channel
into a Landauer-B ̈uttiker model as illustrated in Fig 1b.
Finally, we are able to reconstruct the atomic density in
a wide region around the QPC by monitoring the atom
losses as the position of the near-resonant tweezer is var-
ied.
This paper is structured as follows.  In Sec. II, we re-
view the polarizability of alkali atoms in high magnetic
fields.  In Sec. III, we adapt the Landauer formalism to
the  presence  of  particle  losses.   In  Sec.  IV,  we  describe
the experimental setup and the loss mechanims induced
by the near-resonant light, justifying the validity of the
analysis  of  Sec.  III.  Finally,  we  compare  the  extended
Landauer formalism to our measurements in Sec. V.

LI POLARIZABILITY IN HIGH MAGNETIC
FIELDS
In  the  following,  we  briefly  review  how  to  compute
the atomic polarizability in presence of a high magnetic
field, which is particularly relevant when the interaction
strength  can  be  controlled  using  a  Feshbach  resonance
such  as
6
Li.   Choosing  the  frequency  and  intensity  of
a  near-resonant  beam  to  tailor  different  optical  poten-
tials and losses for each internal state of ultracold lithium
atoms.  We will focus in presenting regimes where the op-
tical potential is of equal magnitude but opposite sign for
the two relevant states in the experiment, emulating an
effective Zeeman shift.

For a given polarization, the transitions between these

and
2P

occur  at  different  frequencies,  typically  offset  by
a magnetic-field dependent shift comparable to the hy-
perfine coupling.  Tuning the light frequency in the vicin-
ity of these transitions leads to strongly state-dependent
polarizabilities which can be exploited experimentally.
As  an  example,  and  along  the  lines  of  our  compan-
ion  paper  [32],  the  differential  light  shift  created  by  a
near-resonant beam can be reinterpreted as an effective
Zeeman  shift.   We  therefore  aim  at  creating  the  maxi-

The  last  term  in  the  sum  of  (9)  represents  fluctua-
tions  and  is  necessary  to  preserve  fermionic  commuta-
tion relations.  Using an imaginary potential is a minimal
way to capture non-Hermitian dynamics [9] that neglects
this last term.  This ignores the stochastic nature of the
loss processes and applies well to particles described by a
macroscopic wavefunction such as photons or condensed
bosons [19, 34].  Although unpaired fermions are not de-
scribed by a macroscopic wavefunction, the last term of
(9) can still be neglected in our case since it will not con-
tribute to macroscopic response functions measured over
times very large compared to the fluctuation timescales.
Therefore, the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach (11)
should be sufficient to model the conductance measure-
ment in a transport experiment, performed for durations
much longer than the typical scattering time Γ

The different transverse modes of the QPC are charac-
terized by the quantum numbersn= (n
x
,n

) describing
the transverse wavefunction along the harmonically con-
fined directions.  We will restrict the analysis to the first
transverse moden= (0,0), which is valid at low chemical
potentials in the reservoirs.
The transmisssionT(E) is computed from the longi-
tudinal, complex-valued, spin-dependent potentialV
σ
(y)
that  the  particles  experience  as  they  travel  along  the
QPC  region.   To  this  end,  forward  and  backward  scat-
tering  amplitudes  associated  with  this  complex  poten-
tial  are  computed  by  solving  the  time-independent  1D
Schr ̈odinger equation with Numerov’s method [35]. Their
square moduli are equal to the energy-dependent trans-
missionT(E)  and  reflectionR(E)  respectively,  and  do
not sum up to one since the total probability amplitude
is not conserved by the non-unitary evolution.  The loss
probabilityL(E) is defined as the missing probability,
T(E) +R(E) +L(E) = 1.(13)
C.    Landauer-B ̈uttiker formula
In the Landauer-B ̈uttiker picture presented in Fig. 1b,
transport  arises  from  the  sum  of  a  right-moving  and  a
left-moving current of particles with the Fermi-Dirac dis-
tributionsf

transport.
In contrast to the net current (19), the absolute par-

IV.    EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
In this section, we present the characteristics of the ex-
periment and of the conductance measurements.  We also
justify why the scattering of a photon, normally associ-
ated with a large momentum kick, can be modeled by a
local particle loss without increasing the total energy of
the system.
A.    Experimental parameters
We prepare atoms in the geometry depicted in Fig 1a
of an atomic QPC consisting of two reservoirs connected
by a 1D region where the atomic density is tunable.
We start by producing a degenerate cloud of
6
Li atoms
in a balanced mixture of|↓〉and|↑〉(the first and third
lowest  hyperfine  states),  with  a  typical  temperature  of
T= 66(12) nK andN= 1.1(1)·10
5
atoms per spin state.
Before starting the transport experiment,  the magnetic
field is ramped to a value of 568 G and 574 G for Fig 3
and Fig 4-6 where the scattering length between the two
components isa= 0(7)a
0
anda= 91(7)a
0
, respectively.
The  atoms  are  thus  very  weakly  interacting  and  atom-
atom scattering is expected to be weak, even in the 1D
region of the QPC.
The cloud is then shaped into two reservoirs by pro-
jecting the different optical potentials,  see Fig 1a.  The
vertical  (resp.   horizontal)  confinement  is  provided  by
a  beam  propagating  alongx(resp.z)  with  a  waist
alongyofw
z
=  30.2μm  (resp.w
x
=  5.9μm)  with
maximum confinement frequencyν
z
= 9.03(5) kHz (resp.
ν
y
=  14.0(6) kHz).   The  length  of  the  QPC  is  mainly
defined by the shortest waist of the constriction beams,
namelyw

.   The  mean  chemical  potential  of  the  reser-
voirs is typicallyμ

density in and around the 1D region is tuned using an at-

imum potentialV
g
.  This increases the local value of the
chemical potential relevant for understanding transport

light  beam  whose  frequency  can  be  tuned  between  the
two resonances for states|↑〉and|↓〉of the D

line forσ

polarized light (see Fig 2ab).  This beam is shaped into
a Gaussian profile with a waist ofw

to a digital micromirror device that allows for aberration
correction and precise positioning inside the constriction
[31].  Its power ofP

At the end of an experimental cycle, the atomic density
of the cloud is recorded using absorption imaging.  The
density profile is then fitted to the equation of state of the
non-interacting Fermi gas to extract the atom number,
temperature and chemical potential of each reservoir.
B.    Transport measurement
Transport  experiments  are  performed  by  introducing
an initial atom number between the two reservoirs and
letting the system relax to equilibrium via the flow of par-
ticles of each internal state through the ballistic channel.
Typically,  we  prepare for  each  spin  state  atom  number
differences of ∆N(0) = 45(3)·10
3
.  As demonstrated in
previous  works,  in  the  absence  of  dissipation,  this  sys-
tem is very well described using Landauer-B ̈uttiker the-
ory [27].
When  the  temperature  difference  between  the  reser-
voir is zero,i.e.∆T= 0,  the particle current through

7
the QPC is linear in the chemical potential between the
reservoirs following equation (21). The linear approxima-
tion is valid for the weak interaction strengths considered
here [38].  They also ensure that spin drag is negligible
and that biases, currents, and transport coefficients can
be treated independently for each spinσ∈{↑,↓}(omit-
ted in the rest of the subsection).
The  chemical  potential  for  each  reservoirr∈ {L,R}
and each spin can be furthermore expanded to first order
around the atom number att= 0,dμ

, where

is the compressibility of one reservoir.  Equation (21)
can then be simplified to a closed first order differential
equation in the atom number difference ∆N.  This dif-
ference is an exponentially decreasing function of time,
showing that the atomic QPC is the analogue of an RC
circuit for neutral atoms, with a time constant

Using  thermodynamical  variables  such  asT,μorκ
is possible as long as the reservoirs can be described by
thermal states,  which is valid when the scattering time
in the reservoirsτ
s
is small compared to the character-
istic  timescale  of  the  transportτ.   The  scattering  time
can  be  approximated  byτ
s

peak density andv

center, andσis the interatomic scattering cross-section.
For  a  scattering  length  ofa=  91a
0
,τ
s
=  0.08 s  while
τis  on  the  order  of  several  seconds  for  a  conductance
around 1/h.  In the absence of atom-atom scattering for
a=  0(7)a
0
,  even  though  this  assumption  should  for-
mally  break  down,  we  expect  the  reservoirs  to  remain
approximated by thermal states since atom number vari-
ations due to transport and losses are smaller than 10%
per  reservoir.   Such  an  agreement  between  observables
in thermalized and non-thermalized regimes was already
noted in our previous experimental work [27], and is fur-
thermore supported by theoretical studies on the validity
of the Landauer formalism both in presence of incoherent
baths or in a complete microcanonical picture [39].
C.    Loss mechanisms
When an atom scatters a near-resonant photon, it gets
a large kinetic energy corresponding to the two momen-
tum  kicks  associated  with  the  absorption  and  sponta-
neous reemission of the photon.  It is therefore not lost
immediately  but  travels  through  the  cloud  of  trapped
atoms and can interact with them.  In this subsection, we
show that an atom that underwent a scattering event can
be considered as lost for moderate interaction strengths
between  the  two  component  of  the  gas.   This  requires
to study (i) the single particle dynamics after a photon
scattering event as well as the subsequent scattering with
(ii) atoms inside the wire and (iii) atoms in the reservoir.

verse QPC modes, described by the Lamb-Dicke param-
eterη

They are however directed towards the reservoirs along

Once the atom has scattered a photon, it is projected
into an excited state of the 2D harmonic oscillator whose
quantum number isn

on average and can still
scatter with another low energy atom in the wire.  With
strong harmonic confinement in two directions of space,
the s-wave scattering properties can be modified by con-
finement  induced  resonances  [40].   Using  [41],  we  can
compute  the  transmission  probability  associated  to  the
scattering event of an atom in (n
x
,n
z
) with an atom in
the ground state of the two transverse harmonic oscilla-
tor  at  a  relative  momentum  ofk
R
=  2π/λ.   The  prob-
ability  that  the  atoms  are  transmitted  without  chang-
ing  their  oscillator  and  momentum  states  is  equal  to
T= 1−6.1·10
−4
, which has to be exponentiated by the
number of potential atom-atom scattering events in the
channel.  There is therefore less than 0.4% chance that
such a collision happens with any atom in the wire, hence
scattering events between the energetic particle and the
atoms in the channel can be neglected.
When an atom at the recoil velocity enters the three-
dimensional reservoirs, the relevant quantity to consider
is its mean free path`= 1/ ̄nσ.  For the largest interac-
tion strength considered here, its value is`= 3.26(5) mm,
much  larger  than  the  reservoir  size  of  approximately
0.2 mm.  Since the recoil energy is larger than the depth
V
trap
=k
B
·0.55μK of the optical trap defining the reser-
voirs, scattered atoms eventually escape the system and
do not contribute to a global energy increase for the weak
interactions.
Therefore, for weak s-wave interactions, an atom which
has scattered a photon can be considered as lost and the
formalism of section III applies.

evolution of the total atom number and relative imbal-
ance for a fixed value of the detuning to the simulation.
From this evolution, we can extract the conductance of
the QPC and demonstrate that the expected conductance
plateaus remain visible even at large local chemical po-
tential, with a value renormalized by the loss probability.
We then vary the detuning of the near-resonant tweezer
to show the validity of the Landauer-B ̈uttiker model even
when the tweezer is brought on resonance with one of the
two spin states.  Last, varying the position of the tweezer
in  the  channel  generates  losses  proportional  to  the  lo-
cal atomic density, allowing to map it in and around the
QPC.
A.    Atom number evolution in the reservoirs
In a first measurement, we study the evolution of the
atom number in each reservoir as a function of time both
experimentally and numerically.
With the experimental setup and parameters described
in subsection IV A, the photon scattering rates are equal
for  the  two  internal  states  while  the  potentials  are  of
equal and opposite magnitude, as illustrated in Fig. 2ab.

at the
center of the tweezer, the atom losses are moderate since
they represent less than 10% of the total atom number.
This  experiment  is  reproduced  by  a  numerical  simu-
lation  following  section  III D  using  the  parameters  ob-
tained experimentally (near-resonant beam intensity, ini-
tial atom number, initial imbalance, temperature).  The
numerical results shown in Figs. 3cd are largely consis-
tent  with  the  experimental  results,  indicating  that  for
moderate values of the conductance, neglecting fluctua-
tions, extending the Landauer-B ̈uttiker model and inte-
grating the time evolution of the cloud properties as in
section III are a valid approach.  The simulation also in-
dicates that losses should be smaller for|↑〉-atoms which
are blocked by the spin-dependent potential and there-
fore have lower densities in the dissipative region.  This
effect  nevertheless  remains  elusive  in  the  experimental
data, partly because of the uncertainty in the measured
atom numbers.
B.    Preserving the conductance plateaus at a lossy
QPC
In Section III, we have showed that transport observ-
ables  are  sensitive  only  to  scattering  at  energies  close
to the Fermi level which concerns a small fraction of all
atoms  subject  to  near-resonant  light.   Conductance  is
therefore expected to be robust against losses.  As illus-
trated in Fig. 1b (brown areas), most of the losses actu-
ally concern atoms that are below the Fermi surface (25)
and therefore do not affect conductance.
This is verified by integrating the simulation results of
the Fig. 3 overt= 4 s of transport time.  We thus obtain
the number of atoms transmitted or lost and participat-
ing or not to transport (subscript ’c’ and ’nc’)

FIG. 4.Conductance plateaus are preserved at a lossy
QPC.(a) Breakdown of the simulated numbers of lost and
transmitted atoms as a function of their energy using the pa-
rameters of Fig. 3 integrated over a transport time of 4 s.  This
highlights one reason for the robustness of transport observ-
ables.   The  total  number  of  lost  (resp.   transmitted)  atoms
[first  bar  of  the  chart]  can  be  decomposed  into  two  parts,
shown in filled (resp.  hatched) region:  (i) those which do not
contribute to transport [equation (18) and (25), brown region
in  Fig.  1  and  second  bar  of  the  chart]  and  (ii)  those  which
could contribute to transport [equation (17) and (24), orange
region in Fig. 1 and third bar of the chart], see text for details.
The relative fraction of lost atoms in each category, indicated
on top of each bar, shows that the losses are less important
for the atoms participating to transport (due to their higher
velocities)  than  for  the  other  atoms,  hence  conductance  is
weakly affected by the losses.  (b) Quasi-1D potentials along

Recording  conductance  as  a  function  of  local  chemi-

In a Landauer picture valid for weak interactions, these
losses  contribute  to  decreasing  the  conductance  by  the
scattering probability.  This probability is computed to
be  21%  in  Fig.  4a  and  is  consistent  with  the  decrease

Bringing the tweezer on resonance with one of the two
states  leads  to  its  entire  loss  after  4 s,  while  the  other
non-resonant  state  still  displays  quantized  conductance
(Fig. 5a and d).  The applicability of the Landauer theory
highlights that the coupling between spins is negligible at
this scattering length.
In addition,  tuning the frequency by
 ̄
δ=−40.6 MHz
towards the resonance of|↑〉leads to a shift of the conduc-
tance curve towards higher chemical potentials (Fig. 5b,
blue),  since  the  repulsive  potential  barrier  and  scatter-
ing  rate  for  that  state  are  increased.   Meanwhile,  the
conductance of|↓〉(Fig. 5b, orange) approaches the one
measured in the absence of near-resonant light.
The  reverse  trend  is  observed  with  a  detuning
 ̄
δ=
+40.6 MHz,  where  the  conductance  of|↓〉is  clearly  re-
duced due to increased losses (Fig. 5c).  These measure-
ments show good agreement with the previous Landauer
model without having to add any fit parameters.
The good agreement demonstrates the applicability of
the Landauer-B ̈uttiker formula over a wide range of dis-
sipation strengths.
D.    Scanning gate microscopy with losses
We have so far studied the effect of dissipation in the
transport structure, developing an extension to the Lan-
dauer model; now we can further use the dissipative beam
as  a  density  probe.   The  near-resonant  tweezer  is  cor-
rected for aberrations using a digital micromirror device
in Fourier configuration.  A discretized grating therefore
controls  the  phase  front  of  the  beam  which  determines
its position inside the QPC at the sub-micron level.  We
take  advantage  of  this  precise  positioning  by  recording
the total atom loss as a function of the tweezer position
to  infer  the  local  atomic  density.   We  perform  this  ex-
periment with a vanishing atom imbalance between the
reservoirs.
To  model  the  situation,  we  assume  that  the  atomic
density is two-dimensional and time-independent.  These
assumptions  hold  provided  that  the  density  variations
along thezdirection are small compared to the Rayleigh
length  of  the  near-resonant  beamz

Repeating  measurements  of  atom  losses  for  different
positions of the near-resonant beam allows us to retrieve
a direct map of the two-dimensional density, as shown in
Fig. 6.  This measurement is conceptually similar to scan-
ning  probe  microscopy  in  solid-state  physics,  and  com-
plements previous imaging techniques for quantum gases
using a focused electron beam [18] or a conservative op-
tical potential in a transport geometry [42].
E.    Conclusion
Adding a near-resonant beam at an atomic QPC leads
to  different  potentials  and  scattering  rates  for  the  dif-
ferent  spin  states.   These  value  can  be  computed  from
the atomic polarizability and used to express the trans-
mission  and  loss  probabilities  of  each  particle  traveling
through the point contact.  This required extending the

11
Landauer-B ̈uttiker  formalism  to  a  situation  with  losses
which reproduces the measurement of the conductance,
where a plateau remains visible although its value is de-
creased with respect to the quantum of conductance 1/h.
It is also possible to integrate the results of this model to
express the time evolution of the atom number and rela-
tive imbalance between the reservoirs of the two-terminal
geometry.    Finally,  the  atom  losses  can  be  related  to
the atomic density at the position of the near-resonant
tweezer which can therefore act as “dissipative scanning
gate microscope” for ultracold gases.
The ability to engineer dissipation in a transport ex-
periment opens the possibility to study the competition
between  losses  and  coherent  transport  by  investigating
the  continuous  Zeno  effect  [43]  or  the  modification  of
transport through a mesoscopic, dissipative lattice.  Ul-
tracold atoms also allow to vary thes-wave interaction
strength up to point where a paired superfluid is formed.
There,  characteristic  signatures  of  transport  through  a
tunnel barrier can also be strongly influenced by the pres-
ence of dissipation [44].

(Dated:  July 16, 2019)
We study numerically the problem of dynamical thermalization of interacting cold fermionic atoms
placed in an isolated Sinai-oscillator trap.  This system is characterized by a quantum chaos regime
for one-particle dynamics. We show that for a many-body system of cold atoms the interactions, with
a strength above a certain quantum chaos border given by the
 ̊
Aberg criterion, lead to the Fermi-
Dirac distribution and relaxation of many-body initial states to the thermalized state in absence of
any contact with a thermostate.  We discuss the properties of this dynamical thermalization and its
links with the Loschmidt-Boltzmann dispute.
I Introduction
The problem of emergence of thermalization in dynamical systems started from the Loschmidt-Boltzmann dispute
about time reversibility and thermalization in an isolated system of moving and colliding classical atoms [1, 2] (see
the modern overview in [3, 4]).  The modern resolution of this dispute is related to the phenomenon of dynamical
chaos where an exponential instability of motion breaks the time reversibility at infinitely small perturbation (see e.g.
[5–8]).  The well known example of such a chaotic system is the Sinai billiard in which a particle moves inside a square
box with an internal circle colliding elastically with all boundaries [9].
The  properties  of  one-particle  quantum  systems,  which  are  chaotic  in  the  classical  limit,  have  been  extensively
studied in the field of quantum chaos during the last decades and their properties have been mainly understood (see
e.g.  [10–12]).  Thus it was shown that the level spacing statistics in the regime of quantum chaos [13] is the same
as  for  Random  Matrix  Theory  (RMT)  invented  by  Wigner  for  a  description  of  spectra  of  complex  nuclei  [14,  15].
This result became known as the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture [13, 16].  Thus classically chaotic systems (e.g.
Sinai  billiard)  are  usually  characterized  by  Wigner-Dyson  (RMT)  statistics  with  level  repulsion  [13–15]  while  the
classically integrable systems usually show Poisson statistics for level spacing distribution [11, 12, 16].  In this way the
level spacing statistics gives a direct indication for ergodicity (Wigner-Dyson statistics) or non-ergodicity (Poisson
statistics) of quantum eigenstates.  It was also established that the classical chaotic diffusion can be suppressed by
quantum interference effects leading to an exponential localization of eigenstates [17–20] being similar to the Anderson
localization in disordered solid-state systems [21].  The localized phase is characterized by Poisson statistics and the
delocalized  or  metallic  phase  has  RMT  statistics.   For  billiard  systems  the  localized  (nonergodic)  and  delocalized
(ergodic) regimes appear in the case of rough billiards as described in [22, 23].
It was also shown that in the regime of quantum chaos the Bohr correspondence principle [24] and the fully correct
semiclassical  description  of  quantum  evolution  remain  valid  only  for  a  logarithmically  short  Ehrenfest  time  scale
t
E
∼ln(1/~)/h[17, 19].  Here~is an effective dimensionless Planck constant andhin the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy
characterizing  the  exponential  divergence  of  classical  trajectories.   This  result  is  in  agreement  with  the  Ehrenfest
theorem, which states that the classical-quantum correspondence works on a time scale during which the wave packet
remains  compact  [25].   However,  for  the  classically  chaotic  systems  the  Ehrenfest  time  scale  is  rather  short  due
to  an  exponential  instability  of  classical  trajectories.   After  the  Ehrenfest  time  scalet
E
the  quantum  out-of-time
correlations (or OTOC as it is used to say now) stop to decay exponentially in contrast to exponentially decaying
classical correlators [26, 27].  Fort > t
E
the decay of quantum correlations stops and they remain on the level of
quantum fluctuations being proportional to~[26–28].  Since the level of quantum fluctuations is proportional to~
the classical diffusive spreading over the momentum is affected by quantum corrections only on a significantly larger
diffusive time scalet

The  problem  of  emergence  of  RMT  statistics  and  quantum  ergodicity  in  many-body  quantum  systems  is  more
complex  and  intricate  as  compared  to  one-particle  quantum  chaos.   Indeed,  it  is  well  known  that  in  many-body
quantum systems the level spacing between nearest energy levels drops exponentially with the increase of number of

2
particles or with energy excitationδEabove the Fermi level in finite size Fermi systems, e.g.  in nuclei [29].  Thus on a
first glance it seems that an exponentially small interaction between fermions should mix many-body quantum levels
leading to RMT level spacing statistics (see e.g.  [30]).
Furthermore, the size of the Hamiltonian matrix of a many-body system grows exponentially with the number of
particles but since all interactions have a two-body nature the number of nonzero interaction elements in this matrix
grows not faster than the number of particles in fourth power.  Thus we have a very sparse matrix being rather far
from the RMT type.  A two-body random interaction model (TBRIM) was proposed in [31, 32] to consider the case of
generic random two-body interactions of fermions in the limiting case of strong interactions when one-particle orbital
energies are neglected.  Even if the TBRIM matrix is very sparse, is was shown that the level spacing statisticsp(s)
is described by the Wigner-Dyson or RMT distribution [33, 34].
However, it is also important to analyze another limiting case when the two-body interaction matrix elements of
strengthUare weak or comparable with one-particle energies with an average level spacing ∆

.  In metallic quantum

being a diffusion spread time over the dot [35–37].  In this case the main question
is about critical interaction strengthUor excitation energyδEabove the Fermi level of the dot at which the RMT
statistics becomes valid.  First numerical results and simple estimates for a critical interaction strength in a model
similar to TBRIM were obtained by Sven
 ̊
Aberg in [38, 39].  The estimate of a critical interactionU

, called the
 ̊
Aberg
criterion  [40],  compares  the  typical  two-body  matrix  elements  with  the  energy  level  spacing  ∆

between  quantum
statesdirectly coupled by two-body interactions.  Thus the
 ̊
Aberg criterion tells that the Poisson statistics is valid for
many-body energy levels forU < U

and the RMT statistics sets in forU > U

.  In [41] this criterion,
proposed independently of [38, 39], was applied to the TBRIM of weakly interacting fermions in a metallic quantum
dot being confirmed by extensive numerical simulations.  It was also argued that the dynamical thermalization sets

The emergence of thermalization in an isolated many-body system induced by interactions between particles without
any contact with an external thermostat represents the Dynamical Thermalization Conjecture (DTC) proposed in
[41].  The validity of the
 ̊
Aberg criterion was numerically confirmed for various physical models (see [40] and Refs.
therein).   An  additional  confirmation  was  given  by  the  analytical  derivation  presented  in  [42]  showing  that  for  3
interacting particles in a metallic dot the RMT sets in when the two-body matrix elementsUbecome larger than the
two-particle level spacing ∆

.  The
advanced theoretical arguments developed in [43, 44] confirm the relation (1) for interacting fermions in a metallic
quantum dot.
The test for the transition from Poisson to RMT statistics is rather direct and needs only the knowledge of energies
eigenvalues.   However,  the  verification  of  DTC  is  much  more  involved  since  it  requires  the  computation  of  system
eigenstates.  Thus it is much more difficult to check numerically the relation (1) for DTC. However, it is possible to
show that there a transition from non-thermalized eigenstates at weak interactions (presumably forδE < δE
ch
) to
dynamically thermalized individual eigenstates at relatively strong interactions (presumably forδE > δE
ch
).  Thus
for the TBRIM with fermions the validity of DTC for individual eigenstates atU > U
c
∼∆
c
has been demonstrated
in [45, 46] by the computation of energyEand entropySof each eigenstate and its comparison with the theoretical
result given by the Fermi-Dirac thermal distribution [47].
Even if the TBRIM represents a useful system for DTC tests it is not so easy to realize it in real experiments.
Thus, in this work we investigate the DTC features in a system of cold fermionic atoms placed in the Sinai-oscillator
trap created by a harmonic two-dimensional potential with a repulsive circular potential created by a laser beam in
a vicinity of the trap center.  In such a case the repulsive potential in the center is modeled as an elastic circle as in
the case of Sinai billiard [9].  For one particle it has been shown in [48] that the Sinai oscillator has an almost fully
chaotic phase space and that in the quantum case the level spacing statistics is described by the RMT distribution.
Due to one-particle quantum chaos in the Sinai oscillator we expect that this system will have properties similar of
the TBRIM. On the other side the Sinai-oscillator trap has been already experimentally realized with Bose-Einstein
condensate of cold bosonic atoms [49–51].  At present cold atom techniques allow to investigate various properties
of cold interacting fermionic atoms [52, 53] and we argue that the investigation of dynamical thermalization of such
fermionic  atoms,  e.g.
6
Li,  in  a  Sinai-oscillator  trap  is  now  experimentally  possible.   Thus  in  this  work  we  study
properties of DTC of interacting fermionic atoms in a Sinai-oscillator trap.  Here, we consider the two-dimensional
(2D) case of such a system assuming that the trap frequency in the third direction is small and that the 2D dynamics
is not significantly affected by the adiabatically slow motion in the third dimension.

3
Finally, we note that at present the TBRIM model in the limit of strong interactions attracts a high interest in the
context of field theory since in this limit it can be mapped on a black hole model of quantum gravity in 1+1 dimensions
known as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model linked also to a strange metal [54–59].  In fact, the SYK model, in its
fermionic formulation [56], corresponds to the TBRIM considered with a conductance close to zerog→0.  In these
lines the dynamical thermalization in TBRIM and SYK systems has been discussed in [45, 46].  Furthermore, there
is also a growing interest in dynamical thermalization for various many-body systems known also as the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and many-body localization (MBL) (see e.g.  [60–63]).  We think that the system of
interacting fermionic atoms in a Sinai-oscillator trap captures certain features of TBRIM and SYK models and thus
represents an interesting test ground to investigate nontrivial physics of these systems in real cold atom experiments.
This paper is composed as follows:  in Section 2 we describe the properties of the one-particle dynamics in a Sinai
oscillator;  numerical  results  for  dynamical  thermalization  on  interacting  atoms  in  this  oscillator  are  presented  in
Section 3; the conditions of thermalization for fermionic cold atoms in realistic experiments are given in Section 4;
the discussion of the results is presented in Section 5.

and disk radiusr

center as it was the case in the experiments [49].  The Poincare sections at different energies are presented in [48]
showing that the phase space is almost fully chaotic (see Figure 1 there).  The quantum evolution is described by the
Schr ̈odinger equation with the quantized Hamiltonian (2) where the conjugate momentum and coordinate variables
become operators with the commutation relation [x,p

III SINAI OSCILLATOR WITH INTERACTING FERMIONIC ATOMS
Two-body interactions of fermionic atoms
The  two-body  interaction  of  atoms  appears  usually  due  to  van  der  Waals  forces  which  drop  rapidly  with  the
distance between two atoms and the short ranged interaction can be described in the frame work of the scattering
length approach (see e.g.  [64, 65]).  Therfore we assume that the finite effective interaction ranger
c
is significantly
smaller than the disk radiusr
d
and the typical size of the wave function, i.e.r
c
r
d
.  Such a short range interaction
is indeed used to modelize atomic interactions in harmonic traps (see e.g.  [66]).  For example in a typical experimental
situation the disk radius is of the order of micronr
d
∼1μm= 10
−4
cmwhile for Li and other alkali atoms we have
r
c
∼3×10
−7
cm[64, 65].
In the following,  we use a simple interaction function having a constant amplitudeUforr≤r
c
and being zero
forr > r
c
where we simply chooser
c
= 0.2r
d
which corresponds well to the short range interaction regime.  The
precise value ofr
c
is not very important since a slight modificationr
c
→ ̄r
c
can be absorbed in a modified amplitude
according toU→
 ̄
U=U( ̄r
c
/r
c
)
2
, a relation we verified numerically for various values of  ̄r
c
< r
d
.  We mention that
in experiments the strength of the interaction amplitude can be changed by a variation of the magnetic field via the
Feshbach resonance [67].

Reduction to TBRIM like case and its analysis
Using the methods described in [48] we numerically compute a certain number of one-particle or orbital energy
eigenvaluesε
k
and corresponding eigenstatesφ
k
(r) of the Sinai oscillator (2).  As repulsive interaction potentialv(r)
we choose the short ranged box functionv(r) =Uif|r| ≤r
c
= 0.2 (sincer
d
= 1) andv(r) = 0 otherwise.  Here
the parameterU >0 gives the overall scale of the interaction strength depending on the charge of the particles and
eventually other physical parameters.
Therefore the corresponding many-body Hamiltonian withMone-particle orbitals and 0≤L≤Mspinless fermions
takes the form:

in the literature, when expressing a two-body interaction potential in second quantization, one usually uses the raw
matrix elements

V

with an additional prefactor of 1/2 and full independent sums for the four indicesi,j,kand
l.  Using the particle exchange symmetry:
 ̄
V

V
ji,lk
one can reduce thei,jsums toi < jwhich removes the
prefactor 1/2 (after exchanging the index nameslandkfor thei > jcontributions and exploiting that contributions
ati=jorl=kobviously  vanish).   The  definition  of  the  anti-symmetrized  interaction  matrix  elementsV
ij,kl
according to (5) allows to reduce also thek,lsums tok < l.  Furthermore, the ordering of the two fermion operators
c
l

k
in (4) is also important and necessary to obtain positive expectation values if the interaction is repulsive.  The
anti-symmetrized  matrix  elementsV
ij,kl
correspond  to  aM

matrix  withM

=M(M−1)/2).   In  order  to
avoid a global shift of the non-interacting eigenvalue spectrum due to the interaction we also apply a diagonal shift
V

∑

to ensure that this matrix has a vanishing trace[74].  Of course such a global energy
shift and does not affect the issues of thermalization, interaction induced eigenfunction mixing or the quantum time
evolution with respect to the HamiltonianHetc.

Aberg parameter
In absence of interaction the energy eigenvalues of (4) are given as the sum of occupied orbital energies:
E({n

where{n

states in the usual occupation number representation:|n

orbitals starting from the right side.
The distribution of the total one-particle energies (6) is numerically rather close to a Gaussian (sincen

quasi-random numbers) with mean and variance (see also Eq.  (A.4) of Ref.  [46]):

one-particle energy eigenvalues obtained from the numerical diagonalization of the one-particle Sinai HamiltonianH

given  in  (2).   However,  to  get  some  analytical  simplification  for  largeMone  may  use  the  one-particle  density  of

For the question if the interaction strength is sufficiently strong to mix the non-interacting basis states the important
quantity is the effective level spacing of states coupled directly by the interaction ∆
c

√
2π[σ

(L= 2)/K] where
K= 1 +L(M−L) +L(L−1)(M−L)(M−L−1)/4 is the number of nonzero elements for a column (or row) ofH
[41, 68] and we need to use the variance for only two particles:

because the interaction only couples states where (at least)L−2 particles are on the same orbital such that (at most)
only the partial sum of two one-particle energies is different between two coupled states.  Even though for two particles
the hypothesis of a Gaussian distribution is theoretically not justified the distribution is still sufficiently similar to a
Gaussian and it turns out that the value of 1/∆

(L= 2)] as the coupled two-particle density of states
in the band center is numerically quite accurate with an error below 10 % (forM= 16 and our choice ofε

values).
According to the
 ̊
Aberg criterion [38, 39, 41] the onset of chaotic mixing happens for typical interaction matrix
elementsUcomparable to ∆

of  a  long  tail  distribution.   However,  in  our  case  it  turns  out  thatV

such  thatA=  1  ifU=U

Density of states
In this work we present numerical results for the case ofM= 16 orbitals andL= 7 particles corresponding to a
many-body Hilbert space of dimensiond=M!/(L!(M−L)!) = 11440 and the numberK= 820 of directly coupled
states  of  a  given  initial  state  by  non-vanishing  interaction  matrix  elements  in  (4).   Thus  in  our  studies  the  whole
Hilbert space is built only on theseM= 16 orbitals.  We diagonalize numerically the many-body Hamiltonian (4)
for  various  values  ofAin  the  range  0.025≤A≤200.   We  have  also  verified  that  the  results  and  their  physical
interpretation are similar for smaller  cases such asM= 12,L= 5 (withd= 792,K= 246) orM= 14,L= 6
(d= 3003,K= 469).
We  mention  that  forM=  16  andL=  7  we  find  numerically  thatV

more  general  analytical  estimate  for  arbitraryM1  andL1  given  in  the  last  section  (which  would  provide

Our first observation is that, even in presence of interactions, the density of states has approximately a Gaussian
form with the same centerE
mean
given in (7) for the caseA= 0.  This is simply due the fact that the interaction
matrix  has,  by  choice,  a  vanishing  trace  and  does  not  provide  a  global  shift  of  the  spectrum.   We  determine  the
varianceσ

(A) of the Gaussian density of states by a fit of the integrated density of statesP(E) using
P(E) = (1 + erf[q(E)])/2,  q(E) = (E−E

/d
where  the  trace  in  Fock  space  can  be  evaluated  either  by  using  the  matrixHbefore  diagonalizing  it  or  using  its

.  This provides the same behavior as (10) with the very similar numerical valuesσ
0
=
3.013±0.007 andα= 0.00858±0.00008 (forM= 16,L= 7).  We mention that the integrated Gaussian density of
states (9) is not absolutely exact but quite accurate for valuesA≤10.  For larger values ofAthe deviations increase
but the overall form is still correct.  As described in [46] the quality of the fit can be considerably improved if we
replace  in  (9)  the  linear  functionq(E)  by  a  polynomial  of  degree  5.   In  this  case  the  precision  of  the  fit  is  highly
accurate for the full range ofAvalues we consider.  In particular, we use this improved fit to perform the spectral
unfolding when computing the nearest level spacing distribution (shown below).
To obtain some  theoretical understanding of (10)  one can consider  a model where the  initial interaction matrix
elements (5) are replaced by independent Gaussian variables with identical varianceV

there is a considerable range of values 1< A <1/

body eigenstates but where the density of states is only weakly affected by the interaction.  This regime is also known
as the Breit-Wigner regime (see e.g.  [40] for the case of interacting Fermi systems).
Thermalization and entropy of eigenstates
In  the  following,  we  mostly  concentrate  on  valuesA≤10  such  that  the  effect  of  the  increase  of  the  spectral
widthσ(A) is still small or at least quite moderate.  The question arises if a given many-body state, either an exact
eigenstate ofHor a state obtained from a time evolution with respect toH, is thermalized according to the Fermi-
Dirac distribution [47].  As in [45, 46] we determine the occupation numbersn

The many-body states with energies aboveE
mean
are artificial since they correspond to negative temperatures due
to the finite number of orbitals considered in our model.  Therefore we limit our studies to the lower half of the energy
spectrum 29≤E≤39≈E
mean
(forM= 16,L= 7).  In Figure 2 we compare the thermalized Fermi-Dirac occupation
numbern(ε) with the the occupation numbersn
k
for two eigenstates at level numbersm= 123 (1354; withm= 1
corresponding to the ground state) with approximate energy eigenvalueE≈32 (E≈35) for three different
 ̊
Aberg
parametersA= 0.35,A= 3.5 andA= 10.  These states are not too close to the ground state but still quite far below
the band center.
At weak interaction,A= 0.35, both states are not at all thermalized with occupation numbers being either close to
1 or 0.  Apparently these states result from weak perturbations of the non-interacting eigenstates|0000011000110111>
or|1000100011001011>where then
k
values are rounded to 1 (or 0) ifn
k
>0.5 (n
k
<0.5).  Form= 1354 the values
ofn
k
are a little bit farther away from the ideal values 0 or 1 as compared tom= 123 but still sufficiently close to
be considered as perturbative.  Apparently the statem= 123, which is lower in the spectrum (with larger effective
two-body level spacing), is less affected by the interaction than the state 1354.  In both cases the entropySis quite
below the thermalized entropyS
th
(see Table I for numerical values of entropies, energies, inverse temperature and
chemical potential for the states shown in Figure 2).
At intermediate interaction,A= 3.5, the occupation numbers are closer to the theoretical Fermi-Dirac values but
still with considerable deviations.  Here both entropy valuesSare rather close toS
th
.  The state 1354 seems to be
better thermalized than the statem= 123, the latter having a slightly larger deviation between both entropy values.
At stronger interaction,A= 10, both states are very well thermalized with a good matching of both entropy values
(again with the state 1354 being a bit better thermalized than the statem= 123) provided we useE
1p
as reference
energy to compute temperature and chemical potential.  The temperature obtained fromE
ex
is too small because here
the increase ofσ(A) is already quite strong andE
ex
rather strongly deviates fromE
1p
.  Also the value ofS
th
using
E
ex
does not matchS.  Obviously at stronger interaction values it is necessary to useE
1p
to test the thermalization
hypothesis of a given state.

In Figure 4 we present the nearest level spacing distributionp(s) for different values of the
 ̊
Aberg parameter.  To
computep(s) we have used only the “physical” levels in the lower half of the energy spectrum and the unfolding has
been done with the integrated density of states (9) whereq(E) is replaced by a fit polynomial of degree 5.  For the
smallest valueA= 0.2 the distributionp(s) is very close to the Poisson distribution with some residual level repulsion
at  very  small  spacings.   This  is  a  quite  well  known  effect  because  typically  the  transition  from  Wigner-Dyson  to
Poisson statistics (when tuning some suitable parameter such as the
 ̊
Aberg parameter from strong to weak coupling)
is non-uniform in energy and happens first at larger spacings (energy differences) and then at smaller spacings.  The
reason is simply that two levels which by chance are initially very close are easily repelled by a small residual coupling
matrix element (when slightly changing a disorder realization or similar).  ForA= 0.5 there is somewhat more level
repulsion  at  small  spacings  but  the  distribution  is  still  rather  close  to  the  Poisson  distribution  with  some  modest
deviations fors≤1.2.  For the larger
 ̊
Aberg valuesA= 3.5 andA= 10 we clearly obtain Wigner-Dyson statistics
(taking into account the quite limited number of onlyd/2−1 = 5719 level spacing values for the histograms).  These
results clearly confirm that the transition fromA <1 toA >1 corresponds indeed to a transition from a perturbative
regime to a regime of chaotic mixing with Wigner-Dyson level statistics [14].

 ̊
Aberg  parameter  values
A= 0.2 (a),A= 0.5 (b),A= 3.5 (c),A= 10 (d).
A further confirmation thatA= 1 is critical can be seen in Figure 5 which compares the dependence of the entropy
Sof exact eigenstates (lower half of the spectrum) onE
1p
orE
ex
with the theoretical thermalized entropyS
th
(E).
For the
 ̊
Aberg valuesA= 0.2 (andA= 0.5) the entropySof all (most) states is significantly below its theoretical
valueS
th
.  Actually the distribution of data points is considerably concentrated at smaller entropy values which is not
so clearly visible in the Figure.  In particular the average of the ratio ofS/S
th
(E
1p
) is 0.178 forA= 0.2 and 0.522
forA= 0.5.  For the
 ̊
Aberg valuesA= 3.5 andA= 10 most or nearly all entropy values (forE
1p
) are very close to
the theoretical line with the average ratioS/S
th
(E
1p
) being 0.990 forA= 3.5 and 0.998 forA= 10.  ForA= 3.5 the
states with lowest energies are not yet perfectly thermalized and the data points forE
ex
andE
1p
are still rather close.
ForA= 10 all states are well thermalized (when using the energyE
1p
) while the data points forE
ex
are quite outside
the theoretical curve simply due to the overall increase of the width of the energy spectrum.  This observation is also
in agreement with the discussion of Figure 2.  For smaller valuesA <0.2 (not shown in Figure 5) we find that the
data points are still closer to theE-axis while for larger valuesA >10 the data points are clearly on the theoretical
curve  forE
1p
(but  more  concentrated  on  energy  values  closer  to  the  center  with  larger  entropy  values  and  larger
temperatures) while forE
ex
, according to (10), the overall width of the exact eigenvalue spectrum increases strongly
and the data points are clearly outside the theoretical curve (except for a few states close to the band center).

(averaged over several energy eigenvalues inside a given energy cell) are
shown  in  the  plane  of  energyEand  orbital  indexkas  color  density  plot  for  the

comparison with the theoretical occupation numbersn(ε

that atA= 3.5 there is indeed already a quite strong thermalization of most eigenstates.

Thermalization of quantum time evolution

dependent states using the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors ofHto evaluate the time evolution operator.  As initial
states we have chosen four states (forM= 16,L= 7):  (i)|φ

>=|0000100000111111>where a particle at orbital
7  is  excited  from  the  non-interacting  ground  state  (with  all  orbitals  from  1  to  7  occupied)  to  the  orbital  12,  (ii)
|φ

and|φ

by rounding the occupation numbersn
k
to 1 (or 0) ifn
k
>0.5 (n
k
<0.5) (states of top panels in Figure 2).  The
approximate energies (6) of these four states areE≈30 (|φ

happens att≥∆t(or later in case of very weak interaction).  Furthermore, by analyzing the time evolution in terms

The linear time scale used in Figure 7 is not very convenient since it cannot well capture a rapid decay/increase of
n
k
at small times and its maximal time value is also significantly limited below the Heisenberg time.  Therefore we use
in Figures 8 and 9 a logarithmic time scale with 0.1 ∆t≤t≤10

values for each cell are not time averaged but represent the precise values for certain, exponentially increasing,
discrete time values (see caption of Figure 8 for the precise values).  Therefore in case of periodic oscillations ofn
k
there will be, for larger time values, a quasi random selection of different time positions with respect to the period.

Using the time dependent valuesn

Att= 0 we have obviouslyS(0) = 0 since all four initially considered states we have perfect occupation number

saturates then at some maximal value which may correspond (or be lower) to the thermalized entropyS

according to the different cases visible in Figures 8 and 9.  However, in absence of thermalization we see that there
may also exist periodic oscillations with a finite amplitude at very long time scales.

The periodic (or quasi-periodic) time dependence ofn
k

initial state with lower energy, indicates that for such states only a small number (2,3, ...) of exact eigenstates ofH
contribute mostly in the expansion of|ψ(t)>in terms of these eigenstates.

Figure  10  also  shows  that  the  initial  increase  ofS(t)  is  rather  comparable  between  the  two  states  for  identical
values  ofAeven  though  the  long  time  limit  might  be  very  different.   Furthermore  a  closer  inspection  of  the  data
indicates that typicallyS(t) is close to a quadratic behavior fort.∆tbut which immediately becomes linear for
t&∆tsimilarly as the transition probabilities between states in the context of time dependent perturbation theory.
To study the approximate slope in the linear regime we define [76] the quantity Γ

forA≤2  but  not  for  larger  values  ofAwhere  the  decay  time  is  reduced  and  not
sufficiently large in comparison to the initial quadratic regime.  Therefore the quadratic term in the exponential is
indeed necessary to obtain a reasonable fit quality.  This procedure corresponds to an effective average of the value of
ξbetween 1 and roughly 1/γ
1
which is indeed useful to smear out some oscillations in the initial increase ofS(t) for
smaller valuesA≤1.
Figure 11 shows the dependence of these values of Γ
c
on the parameterAfor our four initial states.  At first sight
on observes a behavior Γ
c
∝A

forA.2 and a saturation for larger values ofA.  However, a more careful analysis

18
shows that there are modest but clearly visible deviations with respect to the quadratic behavior inA(power law
fits Γ

1≤t/∆t≤50 and if 5/Γ
F
<50, corresponding to a rapid decay (which happens for larger values ofA) we repeat the
fit for the reduced interval 1≤t/∆t≤5/Γ
F
.  The choice of the AmplitudeC6= 1 and the conditiont≥∆tfor the fit
range allow to take into account the effects due to the small initial window of quadratic decay.  In Figure 12 we show
two examples for the initial state|φ

time valuet
max

≈13.5 (ifA= 10) defines the maximal time value for the fit range.  For
A= 10 the fit nicely captures the decay for 1≤t/∆t≤6 while forA= 3.5 there are also some oscillations in the
decay function for which the fit procedure is equivalent to some suitable average in the range 1≤t/∆t≤30.  For very
small values ofAthe fit procedure works also correctly since it captures only the initial decay which is important if
p

depending on initial states).  These values match quite well the observed time values at which the initially occupied
orbitals start to decay (see above discussion of Figures 8 and 9).

a sum over afull completebasis set of orbitals with infinite number (case of continuousx,yvalues) or a very large
number (case of discretex-ygrid) significantly larger than the very modest number of orbitalsMwe used for the
numerical solution of the many-body Sinai oscillator.
However, we can simply state that in our model, by construction, all orbitals withk > Mare never occupied such
that in the expectation value forρ(x,y,t) only the valuesk≤Mare necessary.  Taking this into account together
with the fact that the one-particle eigenstates are real valued, we obtain the more explicit expression:

>and four time
valuest/∆t= 0.1,30,100,1000.  Since the densityρ(x,y;t) does not provide a lot of spatial structure we also show
in Figure 14 the density difference with respect to the initial condition ∆ρ(x,y;t) =ρ(x,y;t)−ρ(x,y; 0) which reveals
more of its structure (figures and videos for the time evolution of this and other cases are available for download at
the web page [69]).
At the timet/∆t= 0.1 density matrix and spatial density are essentially identical to the initial condition att= 0.
For ∆ρwe see a non-trivial structure since there is a small difference with the initial condition and the color plot
simply amplifies small maximal amplitudes to maximal color values (red/yellow for strongest positive/negative values
even if the latter are small in an absolute scale).  The density matrix is diagonal and its diagonal values are either
1 (for initially occupied orbitals) or 0 (for initially empty orbitals) and the spatial density simply gives the sum of
densities due to the occupied eigenstates.
Att/∆t=  30  we  see  a  non-trivial  structure  in  the  density  matrix  with  a  lot  of  non-vanishing  values  in  certain
off-diagonal elements.  Furthermore the orbitals 13 and 16 are also slightly excited (see also discussion of Figure 8)
and there is a significant change of the spatial density.
Later att/∆t= 100 the number/values of off-diagonal elements in the density matrix is somewhat reduced but
they are still visible.  Especially between orbitals 12 and 13 as well as 14 and 15 there is a rather strong coupling.
Orbital 13 is now stronger excited than the initially excited orbital 12.  Also orbital 14 and 15 are quite strong.  The
spatial density has become smoother and the structure of ∆ρis roughly close to the case att/∆t= 30 but with some
significant differences.
Finally att/∆t= 1000 the density matrix seems be diagonal with values close to the thermalized values.  There
is  a  further  increase  of  the  density  smoothness  and  ∆ρhas  a  similar  but  different  structure  as  fort/∆t=  100  or
t/∆t= 30.
Apparently at intermediate times 20≤t/∆t≤100 there are some quantum correlations between certain orbitals,
visible as off-diagonal elements in the density matrix which disappear for later times.  This kind of decoherence is
similar to the exponential decay observed in [46] for the off-diagonal element of the 2×2 density matrix for a qubit
coupled to a chaotic quantum dot or the SYK black hole.  However, to study this kind of decoherence more carefully
in the context here it would be necessary to use as initial state a non-trivial linear combination of two non-interacting
eigenstates and not to rely on the creation of modest off-diagonal elements for intermediate time scales as we see here.
The spatial density is globally rather smooth and typically quite well given by the “classical” relationρ(x,y;t)≈

(t) in terms of the time dependent occupation numbers.  Only for intermediate time scales with more
visible quantum coherence (more off-diagonal elementsn
kl
(t)6= 0), this relation is less accurate.  However, atA= 3.5
the density still exhibits small but regular fluctuations in its detail structure as can be seen in the structure of ∆ρ
for later time scales.  A closer inspection of the data (for time values not shown in Figure 14) also shows that even at
long time scales there are significant fluctuations ofρwhentis slightly changed by a few multiples of ∆t.
In Figure 14 we also show for comparison the theoretical thermalized quantities where in (17) the density matrix is
replaced by a diagonal matrix with entries being the thermalized occupations numbersn

Figure 7 for this case).

24
imaginary part (which vanishes att= 0 and is typically smaller than the values in maximum domain of real part)
shows a more interesting structure since the color plot amplifies small amplitudes (in absolute scale).  Apart from this
the absolute and real part values for positions outside the maximum domain (far away from the initial position) seem
to decay for long timescales which is also confirmed by the thermalized case.  Even though the case fort/∆t= 1000
seems to be rather close to the thermalized case (for absolute value and real part) there are still differences which are
more significant here as in Figure 14.
In global the obtained results show that the dynamical thermalization well takes place leading to the usual Fermi-
Dirac thermal distribution when the
 ̊
Aberg criterion is satisfied and interactions are sufficiently strong to drive the
system into the thermal state.

V DISCUSSION
In this work we demonstrated the existence of interaction induced dynamical thermalization of fermionic atoms in
a Sinai-oscillator trap if the interaction strength between atoms exceeds a critical border determined by the
 ̊
Aberg
criterion  [38,  39,  41].   This  thermalization  takes  place  in  a  completely  isolated  system  in  absence  of  any  contact
with an external thermostat.  In the context of the Loschmidt-Boltzmann dispute [1, 2] we should say that formally
this thermalization is reversible in time since the Schrodinger equation of the system has symmetryt→ −t.  The
classically chaotic dynamics of atoms in the Sinai-oscillator trap breaks in practice this reversibility due to exponential
growth of errors induced by chaos.  In the regime of quantum chaos there is no exponential growth of errors due to
the fact that the Ehrenfest time scale of chaos is logarithmically short [17, 19, 26, 28].  An example for the stability
of time reversibility is given in [27, 28].  In fact the experimental reversal of atom waves in the regime of quantum
chaos has been even observed with cold atoms in [72].  In view of this and the fact that the spectrum of atoms in
the Sinai-oscillator trap is discrete we can say that dynamical thermalization will have obligatory revivals in time
returning from the thermalized state (e.g.  bottom panels in Figure 8) to the initial state (top panels in Figure 8).
This is the direct consequence of the Poincare recurrence theorem [73].  However, the time for such a recurrence grows
exponentially with the number of components contributing to the initial state (which is also exponentially large in
the regime of dynamical thermalization) and thus during such a long time scale external perturbations (coming from
outside of our isolated system, e.g.  not perfect isolation) will break in practice this time reversibility.
We hope that our results will initiate experimental studies of dynamical thermalization with cold fermionic atoms
in systems such as the Sinai-oscillator trap.

ofεwhere the average is doneonly for orbitals with energiesε

with ∆ε= 2.  We note that this is different from the quantityV
mean
used in Section  where the average was done over
all orbitals (up to a maximal number beingM).  The reason for the special average with orbital energies close toε
(which will be identified with the Fermi energyE
F
) is that these transitions are dominant in presence of the Pauli
blockade near the Fermi level.
We  remind  that  according  to  the  discussion  of  Sections   and   the  matrix  elementsV

Due to this shift and the precise average procedure there is a slight (purely theoretical) dependence on the maximal
orbital numberMfor this average (there is a cut-off effect forεclose to the maximal orbital energyε
M
).  Due to this
we considered two values ofM= 30 andM= 60.

We present a simple and compact approach of structured illumination microscopy by using three
2×2 fiber couplers and one 1×4 MEMS optics switch.  One uniform and three fringe illumination
patterns  were  produced  by  placing  seven  output  fiber  tips  at  the  conjugate  Fourier  plane  of  the
illumination  path.   Stable  and  relatively  high-speed  illumination  switching  was  achieved  by  the
optics switch.  Super-resolution and optical sectioned information was reconstructed from 4-frame
data by using algorithms based on a joint Richardson-Lucy deconvolution method and a Hilbert
transform method.  By directly removing the out-focus components from the raw images provides
better imaging results.
I.  INTRODUCTION
Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) has been an
efficient  way  to  enhance  the  resolution  of  the  fluores-
cent microscopy [1].  Compared to confocal microscopy,
SIM has the adventage of being a wide-field imaging sys-
tem,  and has the same optical section capbility as well
[2,  3].   To  achieve  both  super-resolution  (SR)  and  op-
tical sectioning (OS), SIM requires raw SI images with
three or five phase-shifts at three orientations.  To fulfill
this requirements, structured illumination (SI) methods
with phase shift have been achieved by using gratings [4],
SLMs [5, 6], integrated optics chips [7, 8], galvanometers
[9], and other devices [10, 11].
Actually,  the  desire  of  phase  shift  makes  it  complex
and expensive to build a SIM system, which needs those
devices to modulate the phase accurately.  Recently, sev-
eral SR algorithms that require only four raw images (one
wide-field and three SI images) have been proposed [12–
15].   Meanwhile,  it  is  also  possible  to  achieve  OS  from
non-phase-shift raw images [16–18].  On one hand, those
methods increase the frame rate by reducing the number
of  raw  images;  on  the  other  hand,  they  do  not  require
any  phase  shift  of  the  SI  pattern,  which  could  be  used
to simplify the optical setup.  In our previous work [19],
we placed a 2×2 fiber coupler’s output tips at the con-
jugate Fourier plane of the illumination path to produce
fringe patterns at the sample plane.  By rotating the fiber
mount, SI images at multiple orientations (≥3) without
any phase shift were captured and SR result was recon-
structed by a joint Richardson-Lucy (jRL) deconvolution
method [20].  Although this method is simple and low-
cost, both of the quality of the SI pattern and the imaging
speed of system are limited by the mechanical rotation
of the fiber tips.
In this paper,  we proposed an improved SIM system
using three 2×2 fiber couplers and a 1×4 MEMS optics
switch with no moving part.  We modified a commercial
microscope (IX-83, Olympus) by placing seven fiber tips
at the conjugate Fourier plane of the illumination path,
which could provide three SI and one uniform illumina-
tion at the sample plane.  The use of the optics switch
significantly  increased  the  speed  of  SI  pattern  genera-
tion  and  the  stability  of  the  system.   Both  SR  and  OS
images  were  reconstruct  by  using  a  jRL  deconvolution
method and a single-slice optical section algorithm based
on Hilbert transform.  In addition, we presented two dif-
ferent  strategies  to  merge  the  SR  and  OS  components,
and it shows that by directly removing out-focus infor-
mation from each raw images will yield a better imaging
result.
II.  METHOD
Fig.1  shows  a  schematic  diagram  of  our  optical
setup.    A  532  nm  laser  source  (LC-651A  Laser  Com-
biner,   ColdSpring)  is  directly  coupled  into  a  1×4
MEMS  optics  switch  (Ziguan,   Sichuan  China),   SW.
Three  of  switch’s  output  channels  (ch1-ch3)  are  con-
nected to three 2×2 single mode fused fiber optic cou-
plers (TN532R5F2, THORLABS), FC1-FC3, with 50:50
coupling ratio, whose output tips are mounted on a 3D
printed fiber mount, M, in concentric arrangement.  And
the  remained  channel  (ch4)  is  directly  mounted  on  the
center of the fiber mount, while the fiber mount is placed
at the conjugate Fourier plane of the illumination path.
The layout of fiber tips’ position is shown in the upper
panel of the Fig.  1.  All the fiber tips are placed in par-
allel and they directly outputted the light from 2.5μm
cores  which  could  be  considered  as  point  light  sources.
Two lenses (L1-L2) are used to collect and projected the
light  into  the  back  aperture  of  the  microscope.   A  sC-
MOS  camera  (ORCA-Flash  4.0  V2,  HAMAMATSU)  is
used to capture the fluorescent signal.  The tube lens of
the system, L5, is a 180 mm lens.
In this setup, each of the fiber couplers could split the
incident light into two beams which could produce an in-
terference pattern at the sample plane.  Meanwhile, the
light outputted from the center tip could provide a uni-
form illumination.  In other words, 4 raw images (three
SI images and one wild-field image) can be captured by

switching the channel of the optics switch.  As we previ-
ous proposed [19], the frequency of the illumination pat-
terns could be modulated by using different focal length
combination of L1 and L2 or using different fiber mount
with different distance between fiber tips.  It should be
mentioned that L3 (125 mm) and L4 (180 mm) are build-
in lenses of the microscope which is a 4F system, while
L1 and L2 are not.  In practice, we places L1 and L2 as
close as possible to get a higher power efficiency.
As we mentioned above, in our Method, we only cap-
tured one wide-field and three SI images, which did not
contain any phase shift.  Here we employed two methods
to  recover  both  SR  and  OS  information  from  raw  im-
ages.  As for SR part, a jRL deconvolution [20, 21] was
used,  which  reformulated  the  matrix  inversion  problem
as a minimization problem [22]:

1swith the same dimensions as theM.  By inputting all
the captured images,M

, iterations will yield high resolution images.  It should
be mentioned that jRL deconvolution method has no OS
capacity.   Fine  details  about  the  jRL  deconvolution  al-
gorithm could be found in [20, 21].  As for OS part, we
employed  a  single-slice  optical  section  algorithm  based
on Hilbert transform method [16] to demodulate the in-
focus information from each SI images.  Each structured
illuminated image can be considered as the sum of mod-
ulated in-focus signal and unmodulated out-focus signal:

separately represents to the in-
and out-focus components.  A notch filter (filtering out
the±1  peaks  in  Fourier  domain)  and  a  low-pass  filter
was used to estimate unmodulated component of each SI
images,R.   Hence,  the  modulated  in-focus  component
can be separated by subtractingR:
M
IF
(r) =M(r)−R(r).(6)
Then,  the  in-focus  image  can  be  demodulated  using
Hilbert transform [21]:

It should be noted that an accurate estimation of the un-
modulated signal,R, is very important and also difficult
during the demodulation using Hilbert transform [23].
Finally, the high-resolution SR and the low-resolution
OS information should be merged in to one final image.
We employed two strategies (Strategy 1andStrategy
2).  The different performance of these two strategies will
be discussed in more details in the experiment.
Strategy 1:  We  first  estimate  the  SR  image  (S
SR
)
from measured raw images (M
n
) using eq.  1 and the OS
image (S
OS
) by using eq.  8.  Then we mergedS
SR
and

images  in  Fourier  domain  [24,  25]  to  get  the  final
result (S):

III.  RESULT
In  the  experiment,  we  set  the  distance  of  each  fiber
tip  pair  to  6  mm,  and  focal  length  of  L1  and  L2  were
200  mm  and  100  mm.   Considering  the  build-in  lenses,
L3 (125 mm) and L4 (180 mm), those point light sources
(outputted  by  each  fiber  pairs)  were  projected  on  the
back aperture of the OL (UPlanFLN, 60×/1.25, Olym-
pus)  with  a  distance  of  4.32  mm  (the  diameter  of  the
back aperture of the OL was 7.5 mm), which means the
SI  patterns  were  set  to  57.6%  of  the  maximum  spatial
frequency of the excitation light.  The light source used
in the experiment was a 532 nm laser source with a max-
imum power of 100 mW, and a Cy3 filter cube was used
to filter the light.
We first used 0.04μmfluorescent beads (F10720, Red,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) to calibrate our microscope us-
ing the uniform illumination channel of the optics switch
(ch4).  By averaging 22 separated point spots, the point
spread  function  (PSF)  could  be  obtained  by  a  first  or-
der  Gaussian  fitting,  whose  FWHM  (full  width  at  half
maximum) is 341 nm in the experiment.
Then we imaged Rhodamine Phalloidin labeled CaSki
cells  to  verify  both  of  SR  and  OS  performance  of  our
method.  27 layers with a step of 0.1μmin vertical axis
were imaged;  four raw images were captured per layer.
The exposure time was set to 300 ms, and it took about
10 ms for the optics switch to switch illumination chan-
nel.  Then we employed the image reconstruction meth-
ods described above, and both super-resolution and opti-
cal sectioned were achieved.  Fig.  2 (a) shows a 512×512
pixels region of interest atZ= 0.  Fig.  2 (a1) shows a
wide-field image, while Fig.  2 (a4) and (a5) show the re-
constructed results by usingStrategy 1andStrategy
2.  To be more convincing, we also performed the Hilbert
transform method and jRL deconvolution method indi-
vidually,  and  the  results  are  shown  in  Fig.   2  (a2)  and
(a3).  In the image reconstruction, all jRL deconvolution
processing was employed 50 iterations, and the variables
were set as:α= 0.1f
cut−off
,β= 0.5,γ= 0.1f
cut−off
andδ= 1, wheref
cut−off
represents to the cut-off fre-
quency of the microscope.  The settings and applications
of the variables will be discussed later.
As  the  line  fluorescent  distribution  profile  shown  in
Fig.   2  (b),  sub-diffraction  resolution  of    260  nm  was
achieved by using jRL deconvolution; the images recon-
structed by employing only jRL deconvolution method,
Strategy 1andStrategy 2had  been  resolution  en-
hanced.   Moreover,  comparing  toStrategy 1,Strat-
egy 2offered a better optical section performance that
was closer to the result recovered by employing only the
Hilbert  transform  method;  the  intensity  profile  in  red
line  (Strategy 2)  is  more  fit  to  the  green  one  (OS),
comparing the blue one (Strategy 1).  To further ver-
ify  the  optical  section  performance,  Fig.   2  (c1)  -  (c5)
show  the  vertical  cross  section  images  of  all  the  result
in total 2.7μmrange along the blue broken line pointed
out  in  (a1).   As  shown  in  Fig.   2  (a2)  and  (c2),  low-
resolution  out-focus  information  was  removed  by  using
Hilbert transform method, but it lost lots of fine detail
of the sample.  Although fine detail was recover in Fig.  2
(a3) and (c3), jRL deconvolution method cannot achieve
optical sectioning.  Meanwhile,  as shown in Fig.  2 (c4)
and (c5) pointed out by blue arrows, the structure is thin
without any trailing in vertical axis, which indicated that
bothStrategy 1andStrategy 2could obtain super-
resolution  and  optical  sectioned  images.   It  also  shows
that more out-focus information was removed in Fig.  2
(c5) than in (c4), while they have similar resolution.
IV.  DISCUSSION
The  main  purpose  of  this  work  is  to  find  a  compact
and low-cost way to generate fringe illumination, while a
good super-resolution and optical sectioned images could
be achieved.  For optical setup, there are two main parts
of the SI pattern generation method.  One is the genera-
tion of two coherent point light sources.  We used three
fiber  coupler  to  split  one  laser  source  into  point-light-
sources pairs (the output tips of FCs), which could pro-
duce interference patterns at the sample plane in three
orientations.   However,  the  single  mode  fused  fiber  op-
tics coupler we used had a narrow band (532±15 nm),
which limited its application in multi-color imaging.  In
our experience, a planar lightwave circuit (PLC) splitter

by  setting  the  frame  rate  to  200  Hz.   Both  orientation  and
phase distribution of the SI patterns were shown.
with multiple operating wavelengths will be a preferred
choice.  And another part is the switching of the illumina-
tion modes, which was achieved using a 1×4 optics switch
whose switching time about 10ms.  Compared with our
previous work [19], the stability and the imaging speed
was significantly improved in this approach.  As shown in
Fig.  3, we analyzed the different pattern modulation per-
formance of both optics switch and mechanical rotation
by imaging some fluorescent dirt from a highlighter pen.
The frame rate of the camera was set to 200 Hz, and the
time period of each SI channels was set to 200 ms.  As
shown, for mechanical rotation, there was a rapid phase
shifting in random after rotation operation due to the in-
ertia of the fibers in free space, which caused artifacts in
image reconstruction, and it took about 300 ms to stabi-
lize the pattern; for optics switch, the phase was barely
shifted in each orientations, and the orientation switch-
ing was fast, which only took about 10 ms.  Moreover, the
phase was identical in each orientations by using optics
switch, which reflected the stability improvement of the
system in the other way.  However, the switching speed
of the MEMS optics switch is not quite enough for ultra-
high-speed fluorescent imaging.  Integrated optics devices
seem to be a preferred solution of both small volume and
high speed of channel switching in the future, and some
related works have been already proposed recently [7, 8].
As for the image processing, 4-frame SIM data (three
SI  and  one  wide-field  raw  images)  meets  the  minimum
data acquirement to recover the real super-resolution im-
age of the sample fluorescent distribution [22].  And it in-
creased the frame rate in some ways, compared to other
method based on 9- or 15-frame SI raw images.  Mean-
while, using a single-slice algorithm rather than other op-
tical section algorithms based on>1 raw images [2, 26]
could avoid the influence of the uneven excitation inten-
sity of different illumination channels, which could pro-
vide better sectioning performance.
In  the  combination  of  SR  and  OS,  we  employed  two
different  strategies  to  combine  the  results  of  super-
resolution  and  optical  sectioning.   Those  two  strategies
have their own advantages and disadvantages.  InStrat-
egy 1, the jRL deconvolution method and Hilbert trans-
form  method  are  performed  separately,  and  then  these
two  components  were  merged  in  Fourier  domain.It
is  suit  for  all  kinds  of  SIM  methods  where  the  super-
resolution and optical sectioning could individually per-
formed.  However, it brings some artifacts, because that
in the SR part, both in-focus and out-focus components
are deconvolved using jRL method.  InStrategy 2, the
in-focus components of the raw SI images are demodu-
lated by using Hilbert transform method first, and then
we performed jRL deconvolution method with these “in-
focus” data to reconstruct final result.  It provides better
imaging performance because it avoids to jRL deconvolve
the  out-focus  component,  which  lowers  the  modulation
factor  in  pattern  estimation,  and  would  produce  some
higher-frequency artifacts.  However, it relies on a good
estimation  of  uniform  illuminated  image,  which  makes
it only suit for those SIM methods that could provide a
wide-field image or yield a uniform-illuminated image by
summing the SI images.
The settings of those variables’ value in eq.  9 (αand
β) and eq.  10 (γandδ) make significant influence to the
final imaging result; there is a trade-off in the combina-
tion of the super-resolution and optical sectioning.  Ac-
tually, these variables can be divided into two categories
according  to  their  functions:  one  is  to  match  the  spa-
tial frequency range (αandγ); and another is to match
the  intensity  (βandδ).   It  should  mentioned  that,  in
the reconstruction, we assumed that all the out-focus in-
formation was low-frequency, which means that only the
low-frequency  part  of  the  image  needs  to  be  sectioned.
InStrategy 1,  the value ofα(0≤α≤f
cut−off
) de-
termined the frequency range of the merging images; the
low-frequency component (f < α) of the OS image and
the high-frequency component (f > α) of the SR image
are selected. And these two components are finally added
together by an intensity adjustment factorβ(0≤β≤1).
In other words, ifαis too small, there will be little optical
sectioning effect;  in contrast, isαis too large, the final
result will contain the low-frequency artifacts produced
by the single-slice optical section processing.  In the ex-
periment, we setα= 0.1f
cut−off
andβ= 0.5 to achieve
a  good  reconstruction.   Meanwhile,  inStrategy 2,γ
(0≤γ≤f
cut−off
) plays a similar role asαinStrategy
1,  which  limited  the  frequency  range  of  the  out-focus
component  as  shown  in  eq.   10.   Andδ(0≤δ≤1)  is
used to adjust the intensity of the out-focus information
in order to obtain a good estimation of in-focus compo-
nent  of  each  raw  images.   Here  in  the  experiment,  we
setγ= 0.1f
cut−off
andδ= 1 to achieve a comparable
result, comparing toStrategy 1.
V.  CONCLUSION
In summary, we proposed a compact and low-cost ap-
proach  of  generating  structured  illumination  by  using
three fiber optics couplers and one MEMS optics switch.
By placing seven fiber tips at the conjugate Fourier plane
of the illumination path, interference patterns were pro-

5
jected  on  the  sample  plane.   The  switching  of  the  illu-
mination channels using the optics switch is stable and
relatively  high-speed.    Then  super-resolution  and  sec-
tioned image was reconstructed from 4 raw images by us-
ing algorithms combining jRL deconvolution method and
Hilbert transform method.  Moreover, we shows that bet-
ter imaging result could be obtained by directly remov-
ing the out-focus components from the raw images.  Our
method provides a simple way to build a SIM setup under
4-frame SIM framework,  which offers a similar imaging
performance to the conventional SIM setups and has its
potential of commercialization in the future.

Synchronization has great impacts in various fields such as self-clocking, communication, neu-
ral networks, etc. Here we present a mechanism of synchronization for two mechanical modes in
two coupled optomechanical resonators by introducing the so-calledPT-symmetric structure. It is
shown that the degree of synchronization between the two far-off-resonant mechanical modes can be
increased by decreasing the coupling strength between the two optomechanical resonators. Addi-
tionally, when we consider the stochastic noises in the optomechanical resonators, we find that more
noises can enhance the degree of synchronization of the system under particular parameter regime.
Our results open up the new dimension of research forPT-symmetric systems and synchronization.

Introduction.—Synchronization is a phenomenon in
which two or more systems coordinate and act in the
same time with similar behavior. It can be extensively
observed in our daily life, such as the chorusing of crick-
ets, flash of fireflies, applauding of audiences, pendulum
clocks, firing neurons, and even the life cycle of crea-
tures [1, 2]. As synchronization is a qualitative transi-
tion that the rhythms of two or more different objects
are adjusted in unison, it also attracts great interest and
is widely applied to various fields, such as data communi-
cation, time keeping, navigation, cryptography, and neu-
roscience [3–8].
Due to the recent developments of nano-fabrication
techniques, especially those for high-quality-factor on-
chip optomechanical resonators [9], it is possible to
demonstrate synchronization in on-chip nano-scale plat-
forms [10–14]. For example, in Ref. [12], a pair of closely
placed optomechanical resonators with different mechan-
ical frequencies were synchronized by indirect coupling
through the coupled optical fields.  In Ref. [13], two
nanomechanical oscillators separated for about 80μm
were synchronized through the same optical field in an
optical racetrack.  Moreover, in Ref. [14], master-slave
frequency locking was realized between two separated op-
tomechanical oscillators (3.2 km apart) through the light.
In this paper, we show that mechanical oscillations can
be synchronized by optomechanical couplings to two cou-
pled optical modes, in which one is active and the other
one is passive. Such kinds of systems are called parity-
time (PT)-symmetric optomechanical systems, which
have attracted great attentions in recent years [15–20],
and various interesting phenomena have been observed
in the systems withPT-symmetric structure [15–41]. By

introducing thePT-symmetric structure, we observe an
interesting phenomenon that the two mechanical modes
of the coupled optomechanical resonators tend to oscil-
late in unison by decreasing the optical coupling strength
between them. This observation somewhat conflicts with
the normal phenomenon that:  the stronger coupling
strength between two systems is, the easier the synchro-
nization can be realized. Another counterintuitive phe-
nomenon is observed when we consider the noises acting
on the optomechanical resonators. It is shown that more
noises will benefit the synchronization process between
the two mechanical modes of these two optomechanical
resonators.
Synchronization   viaPT-symmetry.—As  shown  in
Fig. 1(a), the system we consider here consists of two cou-
pled whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) resonators.  The
left WGM resonator (μC
1
) is an active one which can
be realized, e.g., by Er
3+
-doped silica disk, and the right
one (μC
2
) is a passive resonator. Each resonator supports
an optical modeα
i
and a mechanical modeβ
i
(i= 1,2),
and the optical coupling strength betweenα
1
andα
2
is
κ. As is well known, although the two mechanical modes
β
1
andβ
2
, located in two different resonators, are not
directly coupled, these two mechanical modes can be in-
directly coupled through the inter-cavity optical coupling
and the intra-cavity optomechanical coupling. We elabo-
rate this indirect mechanical coupling in Fig. 1(b). Each
WGM resonator is equivalent to a Fabry-Perot cavity,
with one fixed mirror and one movable one. The opti-
cal modesα
1
andα
2
represent the optical fields in the
Fabry-Perot cavities and the mechanical modesβ
1
and
β
2
indicate the motions of the movable mirrors. In each
equivalent Fabry-Perot cavity, the movable mirror suffers
a radiation-pressure force induced by the optical mode
α
i
(i=1,2). Such a force is proportional to the circulat-
ing optical intensity|α
i
|
2
in the cavity, which leads to
the mechanical motionβ
i
. In the meanwhile, the mov-
able mirror induces a frequency-shift of the optical mode

2
in the cavity, which influences the dynamics ofα
i
.  In
Fig. 1(b),α
1
(α
2
) andβ
1
(β
2
) interact with each other
through this kind of radiation-pressure coupling, andα
1
andα
2
are coupled through the evanescent optical fields.
Therefore, the mechanical modesβ
1
andβ
2
are coupled
indirectly by the evanescent optical coupling betweenα
1
andα
2
.

is far away from EP, the interaction between the opti-
cal supermodes and mechanical modes, i.e. the effective
radiation-pressure coupling in the supermode picture, is
weak. However, this kind of interaction will be greatly
enhanced asκapproaches toκ
EP
. This results from the
amplification of the optomechanical nonlinearity in the
vicinity of the exceptional point [16–19].
When the degrees of freedom of the optical modes is
adiabatically eliminated under the condition that the op-
tical decay rates are much larger than the mechanical
decay rates, such an enhanced optomechanical nonlin-
earity will induce significant effective frequency shifts

is negligible.  However,
δΩ

will be greatly enhanced such thatδΩ

is almost
comparable with or even larger than Ω

, whenκap-
proaches toκ

.  These enhanced frequency shifts for
the mechanical modes lead to significant modifications
of mechanical frequencies Ω

, which then make
the two mechanical oscillators tend to be resonant with
each other, i.e., Ω

, and thus synchronize. As
is well known, the frequency-mismatch between two syn-
chronized oscillators should be very small in traditional
lossy systems [11, 12], i.e.,|Ω

. How-
ever, as shown in Fig. 2, ourPT-symmetric system can
perfectly synchronize two far-off-resonant mechanical os-
cillators.  In fact, as shown in Fig. 2(a), the effective
mechanical frequencies of the two optomechanical res-
onators Ω
1,eff
and Ω
2,eff
coincide with each other whenκ
approaches toκ
EP
.

In addition, we find an anti-intuitive phenomenon that
weakercoupling between two optomechanical resonators
may behelpfulfor synchronization for ourPToptome-
chanical system. In fact, as shown in Fig. 2(a), in the
PT-symmetric regime (the pink region), when the cou-
pling strengthκbetween two resonators isdecreased,
the effective mechanical frequencies of the two resonators
tend to coincide with each other, which means thatβ
1
andβ
2
are inclined to oscillate in unison with weaker
coupling strengthκin thePT-symmetric regime. The
broken-PT-symmetric regime is the normal regime where
stronger coupling between the two optomechanical res-
onators make the two mechanical modesβ
1
andβ
2
be
inclined to be synchronized.  We can more easily see
this phenomenon by plotting the spectra of the nor-
malized mechanical displacements of the two optome-
chanical resonatorsx

)/2 (the blue dashed curve)
in Figs. 2 (c) and (d), whereκis increased from 2 MHz
to 29.86 MHz in Fig. 2 (c), and is decreased from 50
MHz to 30.81 MHz in Fig. 2 (d). As shown in Fig. 2(c),
with the increase of the inter-cavity coupling strengthκ
in the broken-PT-symmetric regime, the Lorentz spec-
tra ofx
1
(the red-solid curve) andx
2
(the blue-dashed
curve) get closer and finally coincide with each other,
which means that the two mechanical modes are res-
onant.  However, contrary to our intuition, the res-
onant peaks ofx
1
andx
2
get closer with decreasing
κin thePT-symmetric regime as shown in Fig. 2(d).
This anti-intuitive phenomenon comes from the fact that
synchronization only takes place when we approach EP
for two far-off-resonant mechanical modes.  In fact, as
shown in Eq. (2), the optomechanically-induced mechan-
ical frequency-shifts depend not only on the optical cou-
pling strengthκbut also on the optomechanical coupling
strength. When we approach EP in thePT-symmetric
regime, the effective optomechanical coupling strength
will be greatly enhanced [16–19] although the optical cou-
pling strengthκis decreased. The increase of the effec-
tive optomechanical coupling strength compensates the
decrease of the optical coupling strength, which finally
leads to the great modification of the effective mechani-
cal frequencies of the resonators.
We can also understand what we observe in another
alternative way by which we can adiabatically eliminate
the degrees of freedom of the optical modes and obtain
an effective coupling strengthκ

(the blue dashed curve), the cross-correlation function
increases and tends to unit with the increase ofκ, which
means that stronger inter-cavity coupling strength will
be helpful for synchronization as we expect.

merical results of the cross-correlation functionM
cc
be-
tween the two mechanical oscillators in Figs. 3(b) and (c)
by changing the noise strengthDand fixing other param-
eters both in broken-PT-symmetric andPT-symmetric
regimes. It can be seen thatM
cc
is enhanced with in-
creasing noise intensityDboth in broken-PT-symmetric
andPT-symmetric regime, reaches the maximal values
at particular noise level, and then decreases at higher
noise intensity.  It means that synchronization process
may benefit from noises [44–51] in our optomechanical
PT-symmetric system.  To interpret what we observe,
we can see that the noise will randomly shift the fre-
quencies of the mechanical modes, especially when we
approach EP where the effects of noise are enhanced [52–
55]. Since the frequencies of the two mechanical modes
are far-separated, these random frequency shifts may de-
crease the difference between the frequencies of the two
mechanical modes in a certain probability with increasing
noise strengthD, and thus increase the cross-correlation
functionM
cc
. When we increase the noise strengthD
further, the noise will be strong enough to destroy the
periodic oscillation of single mechanical oscillator, and
thus decrease the degree of synchronization between the
two mechanical oscillators. This interpretation can also
be confirmed by checking the variance ofM
cc
versus the
noise strengthD( Fig. 3(b)). The variance ofM
cc
first
increases with increasing noise strengthD(note that
M
cc
increases at the same time), which means that more
noises enter the system althoughM
cc
is increased. The
variance ofM
cc
then decreases when we increaseDfur-
ther, because the value ofM
cc
is too small in this case
and the noise-induced fluctuations inM
cc
are suppressed.
Furthermore, we consider the effects of the ther-
mal noises in the two mechanical modes by calculat-
ing the normalized correlation functionRbetween the
two mechanical modes [56] (see supplementary II B).
In the broken-PT-symmetric regime with optical cou-
pling strengthκ= 27.79 MHz, the normalized correla-
tion functionRis equal to 0.54, which is larger than
0.48 where we ignore the thermal noises.  Similarly, in
thePT-symmetric regime with optical coupling strength
κ= 32.19 MHz,Ris equal to 0.59 which is also larger
than 0.51 where we ignore the thermal noises. This indi-
cates that the thermal noises in the mechanical modes
can also benefit the synchronization between the two
mechanical modes in our optomechanicalPT-symmetric
system.
Conclusion.—We have shown that the mechanical mo-
tions of two coupledPT-symmetric optomechanical res-
onators with far-off-resonant mechanical frequencies can
be synchronized when the system approaches EP. In par-
ticular, in thePT-symmetric regime, the two mechani-
cal modes are easier to be synchronized with less optical
coupling strength between the two optomechanical res-
onators.  Additionally, it is shown that noises will be
enhanced in the vicinity of EP in our system, and the
enhanced noises will benefit the synchronization process
if only the strengths of the noises are not too strong.
Our study opens up new dimension of research forPT-
symmetric optomechanical system for possible applica-
tions such as metrology, cooling, and communication.
It also gives new perspectives for synchronization in op-
tomechanical systems.

This supplement provides additional analysis and derivations on the following topics: (I) mechanism of the syn-
chronization inPT-symmetric optomechanical system; (II) noise-enhanced synchronization inPT-symmetric optome-
chanical system.
I.  MECHANISM OF SYNCHRONIZATION INPT-SYMMETRIC OPTOMECHANICAL SYSTEM
ThePT-symmetric optomechanical system considered is composed of twocoupled optomechanical resonators. One
of these two optomechanical resonators is with an active optical mode, and the other one is with a passive optical
mode. The dynamical equations of the system can be written as

whenκ=κ
EP
=γ. Under the strong intercavity coupling regime such thatκ > κ
EP
, the real parts of the two
eigenfrquenciesω

are the same and the imaginary parts ofω
o±
are different, which corresponds to a mode-splitting
of the optical supermodes with the same damping rates. We call itPT-symmetric regime. In contrast, when the
intercavity coupling strength is weak enough suchκ < κ
EP
, the real parts ofω
o±
are different while the imaginary
parts ofω
o±
are the same, which corresponds to two degenerate optical supermodes with different damping rates.
We call it broken-PT-symmetric regime. Given the system parametersγ

, the simulation results of the mode splitting and linewidth of the optical supermodes are shown in Figs. 1 (a)

It should be pointed out that the degeneracy of the optical supermodes at the exceptional point will be broken by
the optomechanical coupling given byg

shown in Figs. 1 (a) and (b). However, we can omit this non-degeneracy. In fact, if the gain and loss is balanced

1ex

this non-degeneracy will be very small, and the purely optical part of the system can be approximated as aPT-

work.

FIG. 2: (Color online) An active resonator indirectly couples with a passive resonator through two optical fibers.
However, if these two optical resonators are not directly coupledwith each other. Instead, for example, they are
indirectly coupled through add-drop optical fibers, as shown in Fig.2. Then the optical coupling strength between
the two resonators cannot be larger than the external damping rate of each resonator, and thus the system cannot
enter thePT-symmetric regime. To show this, let us see that dynamical equations of the system described in Fig. 2
can be expressed as

By substituting the above equations into Eq. (6), and omitting the optomechanical coupling terms under the condition

, we can obtain the reduced dynamical equations of the optical modes as

Here, we consider the case that loss and gain are balanced (γ

It can be seen that the optical coupling strength between the tworesonators isκ=γ

case, the optical coupling strength cannot be larger than the external damping rateγ

system also cannot enter thePT-symmetric regime sinceκ=γ

C.  The derivation of the reduced dynamical equation of the mechanical modes
Based on the dynamical equation in Eq. (1), we can adiabatically eliminate the degrees of freedom of the optical
modes, and derive the reduced dynamical equations of the mechanical modes. In fact, by rewriting the first two
equations in Eq. (1) in matrix format, we have

. From Eq. (17), it can be seen that the mechanical frequency shifts will be greatly improved
in the vicinity of EP. Given the system parameters in section I A, we show the optomechanics-induced mechanical
frequency shiftsδΩ
1,2
in Fig. 3 (a). When the system is far away from EP, the mechanical frequency shiftsδΩ
1
(red
solid line) andδΩ
2
(red dashed line) are very small, and can be omitted in comparison to the mechanical frequencies
Ω
1,2
. However, both frequency shiftsδΩ
1
andδΩ
2
will be greatly amplified in the vicinity of EP, which will modify
the mechanical frequencies Ω
1,2
such that Ω
1
+δΩ
1

2
+δΩ
2
.  As shown in Fig. 3 (a), in thePT-symmetric
regime of the optical modes, these mechanical frequency shifts are enhanced with the decrease of the optical coupling
strengthκ, which means that smaller coupling strengthκbetween two optical modes is better for synchronization.
In addition, as shown in Fig. 3 (a), the difference between the detuning frequencies of the two optical modes, i.e.,
|∆
2
−∆
1
|, significantly influences the amplification effects of the mechanical frequency shiftsδΩ
1,2
when the system
is around EP. By fixing ∆
2
= 5 MHz, we plot the curves ofδΩ
1,2
for different ∆
1

frequency shiftsδΩ
1,2
are greatly enhanced with the decrease of|∆

fix ∆

is significantly enhanced in the vicinity of EP. Therefore, in thePT-symmetric regime of the optical modes,
weaker optical coupling strength leads to stronger effective mechanical coupling strength, and thus may be helpful for
the synchronization between the two mechanical modes. It is also shown that the degree of amplification ofκ

is
extensively enhanced with the decreasing of|∆

E.  The influence of the effective mechanical coupling on synchronization
In this part we discuss the positive effect of the enhancement of the effective mechanical couplingκ
mech
on the
synchronization between mechanical modes, i.e., the stronger theκ
mech
is, the easier the synchronization is.  For
simplicity and clarity, we re-express the dynamical equation in Eq. (15) by using the differential operator format as
follows
[D+ (Γ

whereDrepresents the differential operator. By eliminating the degree offreedom ofβ
2
, we can derive the dynamical
equation ofβ

, and then obtain the characteristic equation of this coupled system as follows

Here, we consider Γ

.
It can be easily seen that in the weak coupling regime such thatκ
mech
<Ω
Ave−
, the vibration frequencies of the
mechanical modesβ
1,2
are close to each other with the increase of the effective coupling strengthκ
mech
, which means
that the degree of synchronization between the two mechanical modes increases with the increase ofκ
mech
. At the
critical point such thatκ
mech
= Ω
Ave−
, the two oscillators will have the same vibration frequency Ω
Ave+
, which means
that these two mechanical modes are with frequency synchronization, i.e., the frequencies of the two mechanical modes
are equal to each other. It is shown that a stronger effective mechanical coupling strength can improve the degree
of the synchronization between mechanical modes in our system, and finally leads to the frequency synchronization
when the effective mechanical coupling is strong enough.

8
It can be further shown that the two mechanical modes can be in a complete synchronization, i.e., the position and
speed of these two mechanical modes completely coincide with each other, when the effective mechanical coupling
strengthκ
mech
is strong enough. To show this, we rewrite the dynamical equation (15) as follows

the real parts and the imaginary parts ofβ
1
andβ
2
are the positions and momenta of the corresponding mechanical
resonators. Thus, we can see that the positions and momenta of the two mechanical resonators coincide with each
other in the long time limit, which means that the two mechanical resonators are with complete synchronization.
F.  The enhancement of the effective optomechanical interaction
In ourPT-symmetric optomechanical system, there exists an enhancement of the effective optomechanical in-
teraction due to the topological-singularity-induced amplification ofoptomechanical nonlinearity in the vicinity
of the exceptional point [5].  This enhanced optomechanical interaction then leads to the amplifications of the
optomechanics-induced mechanical frequency shiftsδΩ
1,2
and the effective mechanical coupling strengthκ
mech
. Since
the optomechanics-induced mechanical frequency shifts can directly change the frequency of the mechanical modes,
and the increased effective mechanical coupling can also benefit thesynchronization of the mechanical modes, thus
the synchronization between far-off-resonant mechanical modes can be realized with sufficiently large optomechanical
interaction strength. In thePT-symmetric regime, the system approaches to the exceptional point with the decrease
of optical coupling strengthκ, which results in an enhancement of the optomechanical coupling and thus compensates
the reduction of the optical coupling strength. In the following part of this subsection, we will discuss this enhanced
effective optomechanical interaction in ourPT-symmetric optomechanical system.

Since ∆

| ≪κ, γ, the effective optomechanical coupling strengthg
eff
can be greatly amplified in the vicinity
of EP whenκ→γ. This means that in this case the effective optomechanical coupling strengthg
eff
can be greatly
enhanced. Given the parameters in section I A, we can obtain the simulation results of the effective optomechanical
coupling strengthg
eff
versus the optical coupling strengthκ, as shown in Fig. 4. When the optical coupling strengthκ
is far away from the exceptional point, i.e., in the green area in Fig. 4,the effective optomechanical coupling strength
changes linearly with the optical coupling strengthκ. However, in the pink area,g
eff
increases very fast when the
system approaches to EP, which means that in this regime the optomechanical interaction can be greatly amplified.
In addition, by comparing Eq. (23) with Eq. (17) and Eq. (18), we can find that|δΩ

improvements of the optomechanics-induced mechanical frequency shifts and the effective mechanical coupling in the
vicinity of EP.
G.  The difference between activePT-symmetric system and passive system with EP for synchronization
Based on the previous discussion, we know that in the discussed gain-loss balancedPT-symmetric optomechanical
system, there exists amplifications of the optomechanics-inducedmechanical frequency shifts and effective mechanical
coupling strength in the vicinity of exceptional point. However, if thisPT-symmetric system is replaced by a passive
coupled system with an exceptional point, i.e., the active resonatorin the discussedPT-symmetric system is replaced
by a passive resonator, the two far-detuned mechanical modes inthis system cannot synchronize with each other. To
show this, we can easily obtain the dynamical equations of the system by replacing the optical dampingγ

This implies that in this passive system with an exceptional point, the amplifications of mechanical frequency shifts
and effective mechanical coupling are not strong enough. Thus these two mechanical modes with far-off-resonant
mechanical frequencies cannot be synchronized.
In addition, if the balance between gain and loss is broken in ourPT-symmetric system, i.e., Γ
−
=|γ

−γ
2
|/26= 0,
the synchronization between the two mechanical modes will be suppressed. In fact, when the balance between gain

Therefore, with the increase of Γ
−
, the amplification effects of the mechanical frequency shifts and the effective
mechanical coupling strength will be suppressed.  Given the parameters in section I A, we show the mechanical
frequency shiftsδΩ
1,2
and the effective mechanical coupling strengthκ
mech
with different Γ
−
in Figs. 5 (a), (b), and
(c), respectively. It can be clearly seen that the amplifications of the mechanical frequency shifts and the effective
mechanical coupling strength are seriously suppressed when Γ
−
is large, thus the synchronization between the two
mechanical modes with far-off-resonant cannot be realized.

give more insights for synchronization with noises in ourPT-symmetric optomechanical system, we show additional

11
analysis of another index of synchronization—the Kramers rate, which is more suitable to describe noisy synchronized
systems.
The Kramers rates of two subsystems are alternative indices to show the correlation between two subsystems. When
the Kramers rates of two subsystems coincide with each other, the two subsystems are well correlated [7]. We then
calculate the Kramers ratesr
1
andr
2
of the mechanical displacementsx
1
andx
2
, respectively. The Kramers rate is
originally defined as the transition rate between neighboring potential wells of a particle caused by stochastic forces,
which was first proposed by Kramers in 1940 [8]. It can be calculated by the following equation [9]

transition rate between point A and point B (the minimal points of thepotential wells) as shown in Fig. 6, and thus
is equal to the reciprocal of the transition timeτbetween point A and point B, i.e.,r= 1/τ.

FIG. 6: (Color online) Schematic diagram of the potential energy of a particle. Point A and Point C are the minimal points of
the potential wells, and point B is maximal point of the potential barrier. The Kramers rate of the particle is the transition
rate between point A and point C, i.e., the reciprocal of the passage timeτfrom point A to point C.
Here, we use the mean first passage time [10, 11], i.e., the average time that the particle moves from one potential
well to the other well, to evaluate the Kramers ratesr
1
andr
2
of mechanical displacementsx
1
andx
2
. We obtain the
histograms ofx
1,2
through numerical simulation first, and then find out the locationsx
ia
andx
ic
(i= 1,2) with the
maximum probability ofx
1,2
, i.e., the potential wells ofx
1,2
, based on the distribution of histograms, by which we can
obtain the mean first passage timesτ
1,2
, i.e., the average value of the time intervals betweenx
ia
andx
ic
. The Kramers
ratesr
1
andr
2
can then be calculated by the reciprocal of the mean first passagetimesτ
1,2
, i.e.,r
i
= 1/τ
i
(i= 1,2).
The simulation results forr
1
andr
2
are presented in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7(a), the red solid curve and the bluedashed curve
represent the trajectories ofr
1
andr
2
with different values of noise intensityDin the broken-PT-symmetric regime,
where the optical coupling strength is fixed asκ= 27.76 MHz. It can be seen that the Kramers rates of mechanical
displacementsx
1
andx
2
get closer with the increase of the noise intensityD. In thePT-symmetric regime as shown
in Fig. 7(b), similar phenomenon can be observed, i.e., the stochasticnoises tend to decrease the difference between
the Kramers ratesr
1
andr
2
when the noise intensity is increased, where the optical coupling strength is fixed as
κ= 32.19 MHz. These simulation results indicate that the partial frequencies of both mechanical displacementsx
1
andx
2
tend to be consistent with each other when more noises are introduced into thePT-symmetric optomechanical
system. It means that noises can improve the correlation betweenx
1
andx
2
.
B.  Thermal noises in the mechanical modes
In the above analysis we do not consider the effects of the thermalnoises in the mechanical modes. Actually, these
thermal noises in the mechanical modes can also benefit the synchronization between the two mechanical modes in
ourPT-symmetric optomechanical system. In order to simplify our discussions, we assume that the thermal noises
in the mechanical modes are white noises, based on which the Langevin equation of the mechanical modes can be

We	demonstrate	high‐energy	terahertz	generation	from	
a	large‐aperture	(75	mm	diameter)	lithium	niobate	
wafer	by	using	a	femtosecond	laser	with	energy	up	to	2	J.	
This	scheme	utilizes	optical	rectification	in	a	bulk	lithium	
niobate	crystal,	where	most	terahertz	energy	is	emitted	
from	a	thin	layer	of	the	rear
	surface.	Despite	its	simple	
setup,	this	scheme	can	yield	0.19	mJ	of	terahertz	energy	
with	laser‐to‐terahertz	conversion	efficiencies	of	~10
‐4
,	
about	3	times	better	than	ZnTe	when	pumped	at	800	nm.	
The	experimental	setup	is	up‐scalable	for	multi‐mJ	
terahertz	generation	with	petawatt	laser	pumping.	
 
High‐power	terahertz	(THz)	generation	is	of	great	interest	for	its	
own	 study	 and	 potential	 applications	 in	 nonlinear	 THz	
spectroscopy	and	imaging,	as	well	as	exploration	of	terahertz	
driven	extreme	nonlinearities	[1‐4].	Optical	rectification	(OR)	is	
widely	used	to	produce	single‐cycle	broadband	THz	radiation	with	
femtosecond	laser	pulses.	In	general,	OR	is	well	suited	for	scalable	
THz	generation—one	can	simply	increase	the	OR	crystal	surface	
area	with	more	input	laser	energy.	Previously,	a	large‐diameter	
(75	mm)	ZnTe	was	used	to	produce	1.5	J	of	THz	radiation	with	
conversion	 efficiency	 of	 3.110
‐5
	 [5].	 However,	 two‐photon	
absorption	in	ZnTe	with	800	nm	pumping	results	in	laser	energy	
depletion	 and	 THz	 screening	 by	 charge	 carrier	 generation,	
fundamentally	limiting	maximum	useable	laser	intensities	on	the	
crystal	surface.	
Organic	crystals	are	also	commonly	used	for	high‐energy	THz	
generation	 due	 to	 their	 extremely	 high	 nonlinearities	 [6,	 7].	
However,	organic	crystals	have	low	damage	thresholds	with	large	
optical	and	THz	absorption	[6].	Generally,	they	are	not	favorable	
for	optical	pumping	at	800	nm,	and	the	growth	of	large‐size	
organic	crystals	is	also	challenging.	Nonetheless,	monolithic	arrays	
of	partitioned	organic	crystals	have	been	used	to	generate	0.9	mJ	of	
THz	radiation	with	1,250	nm	pumping	[7].		
Lithium	niobate	(LN)	is	another	strong	candidate	for	scalable	
THz	generation	because	of	its	high	nonlinearities	and	damage	
thresholds	[8].	Owing	to	its	large	bandgap	(~4	eV),	LN	is	free	from	
two‐photon	absorption	at	800	nm.	Moreover,	high‐quality,	large‐
size	LN	wafers	are	commercially	available	with	diameters	beyond	
152	mm.	For	efficient	phase	matching	at	800	nm,	a	tilted	pulse	
front	method	is	routinely	used	for	high‐energy	THz	generation	[9‐
14].	Recently,	THz	energy	of	0.2	mJ	was	produced	from	a	68		68		
64	mm
3
	sized	LN	prism	with	laser	energy	up	to	70	mJ	[14].	The	
prism‐based	 geometry,	 however,	 induces	 non‐uniform	 pump	
interaction	due	to	its	large	tilt	angle	of	63	necessary	for	excitation	
at	800	nm.	This	results	in	poor	THz	beam	quality.	The	condition	
can	be	even	worse	with	large	input	beam	sizes,	which	limits	its	
potential	use	with	multi‐joule	laser	pumping.	
In	this	paper,	we	examine	scalable	THz	generation	from	LN	in	
the	form	of	a	large‐area	wafer.	Planar	LN	crystals	are	frequently	
used	as	OR	materials,	but	their	THz	conversion	efficiencies	are	not	
well	known	especially	under	extremely	high	laser	energy	and	
intensity	 conditions.	 Here	 we	 study	 laser	 chirp	 dependent	
terahertz	generation	and	determine	the	ultimate	THz	conversion	
efficiency	in	LN	wafers	at	800	nm	excitation.	
A	schematic	of	our	experimental	setup	is	shown	in	Fig.	1(a).	In	
this	experiment,	a	150	TW	Ti:sapphire	laser	capable	of	producing	
25	fs,	4	J	pulses	at	a	repetition	rate	of	5	Hz	is	used.	Due	to	possible	
cumulative	degradation	of	the	compressor	gratings,	the	laser	is	
operated	in	a	single‐shot	mode.	The	laser	pulse	is	p‐polarized	
(horizontally	polarized	to	the	optical	table)	and	clipped	by	an	iris	
diaphragm	 to	 reduce	 the	 beam	 diameter	 to	 50	 mm	 with	 a	
maximum	laser	energy	of	2	J	after	the	iris.	The	laser	spectrum	is	
centered	at	807	nm	with	a	60	nm	bandwidth	in	full	width	at	half	
maximum	(FWHM)	as	shown	in	Fig.	1(b).	The	laser	pulse	duration	
is	adjusted	by	adding	group	delay	dispersion	(GDD),	either	positive	
or	negative,	with	an	acousto‐optic	programmable	dispersive	filter	
(Dazzler,	Fastlite)	in	the	laser	system.	This	provides	a	pulse	width	
range	of	25900	fs	(see	Fig.	1(c)).	

	Three	types	of	congruent	LN	are	examined	for	THz	
generation—x‐cut	(0.5	mm	and	1.0	mm	thick)	and	y‐cut	(0.5	mm	
thick)	wafers,	all	with	75	mm	diameter.	In	the	setup,	the	LN	wafer	
is	aligned	with	its	extraordinary	z‐axis	parallel	to	the	laser	p‐
polarization	 direction	 for	 maximal	 THz	 generation.	 This	
configuration	yields	p‐polarized	THz	emission.	To	decouple	the	
resulting	THz	radiation	from	its	copropagating	laser	pulse,	two	
optical	windows	coated	with	250‐nm	thick	tin‐doped	indium	oxide	
(ITO)	layers	are	used	to	reflect	the	THz	radiation.	To	minimize	
reflection	 at	 800	 nm,	 the	 ITO‐coated	 windows	 are	 titled	 at	
Brewster’s	angle	of	56.	This	yields	800	nm	and	1	THz	reflection	of	
0.1%	 and	 88%,	 respectively	 [15].	 Double	 reflection	 with	 two	
parallel	ITO	windows	provides	overall	THz	reflection	of	77%,	with	
<0.0001%	reflection	at	800	nm.	The	reflected	THz	pulse	is	brought	
into	air	through	a	10‐mm	thick,	high‐resistivity	Si	window	that	
transmits	 ~50%	 of	 THz	 energy	 but	 completely	 blocks	 the	
attenuated	 laser	 pulse.	 The	 maximum	 laser	 fluence	 on	 the	 Si	
surface	is	0.1	J/cm
2
,	sufficiently	low	enough	to	avoid	potential	
charge	carrier	generation	and	subsequent	THz	screening.	
The	transmitted	THz	pulse	is	focused	by	a	metallic,	90	off‐axis	
parabolic	(OAP)	mirror	with	102‐mm	diameter	and	152‐mm	focal	
length.	The	THz	energy	is	measured	with	a	pyroelectric	detector	
(Gentec,	 THz5D‐MT‐BNC)	 with	 filters	 including	 one	 or	 more	
calibrated	THz	attenuators	(Tydex,	ATS‐5‐50.8),	a	1.0‐mm	thick	Si	
filter,	and	a	lowpass	THz	filter	(Tydex,	LPF‐10.9‐47)	providing	a	
cut‐off	frequency	of	10	THz.	The	responsivity	of	the	detector	is	
measured	at	800	nm	with	0.9	J/V	in	a	single‐shot	mode	(see	Fig.	
1(d))	and	converted	to	1.8	J/V	at	<3	THz	frequencies	by	using	
calibration	data	provided	by	Gentec.		
First,	LN	crystal‐cut	and	laser	chirp	dependence	are	studied.	
Figure	2	shows	THz	output	energy	as	a	function	of	laser	GDD	for	
the	three	types	of	LN.	In	general,	at	laser	energy	below	0.6	J,	the	
shorter	pulse	duration	yields	the	higher	THz	energy.	However,	at	
laser	energy	equal	to	or	great	than	1.2	J,	the	short	pulse	condition	
exhibits	suppressed	THz	signals,	with	a	bit	longer	pulse	width	
conditions	(100200	fs)	yielding	more	THz	radiation.	This	is	due

to	laser	energy	depletion	via	3	photon	absorption	in	LN	occurring	
at	high	laser	intensities.	Note	that	three	laser	photons	(1.5	eV	each)	
can	be	simultaneously	absorbed	to	exceed	the	bandgap	of	LN	(~4	
eV)	 and	 produce	 charge	 carriers.	 A	 similar	 behavior	 was	
previously	observed	with	a	tilted	pulse	front	scheme	using	a	thick	
LN	prism	[13,	14].	Also,	for	the	same	pulse	duration,	the	negatively	
chirped	 ones,	 in	 general,	 yield	 slightly	 higher	 THz	 energy	
compared	to	the	positive	ones.	This	is	due	to	dispersion	in	LN—a	
negatively	chirped	laser	pulse	undergoes	temporal	compression,	
producing	higher	laser	intensity	for	THz	generation,	in	contrast	to	
a	 positively	 chirped	 one	 experiencing	 pulse	 stretching.	
Interestingly,	the	x‐cut	LN	consistently	yields	more	THz	radiation	
than	the	y‐cut	under	the	same	condition.	This	is	unexpected	
because	the	laser	is	polarized	along	the	z‐axis	in	both	cases,	which	
in	principle	should	yield	the	same	linear	and	nonlinear	responses.	
Figure	3(a)	shows	THz	versus	laser	energy	scaling	for	the	three	
LNs.	The	y‐axis	represents	THz	energy	estimated	right	after	the	LN	
crystal.	Here	the	GDD	value	is	fixed	at	‐1,000	fs
2
	for	the	0.5‐mm	
thick	wafers	and	‐2,000	fs
2
	for	the	1.0‐mm	thick	LN.	In	general,	the	
THz	output	energy	continuously	increases	with	input	laser	energy,	
also	exhibiting	saturation	behaviors	with	high	laser	energy	(>1.8	J).	
The	corresponding	laser‐to‐THz	conversion	efficiency	is	shown	in	
Fig.	3(b).	With	the	x‐cut,	0.5‐mm	thick	LN,	the	maximum	THz	
energy	 produced	 is	 ~180	J	 with	 the	 conversion	 efficiency	
approaching	10
‐4
.	
The	radiation	spectrum	is	characterized	with	5	sets	of	metal‐
mesh	bandpass	filters	(Thorlabs)	[16]	and	shown	in	Fig.	3(c).	All	
filters	are	calibrated,	and	their	spectral	transmission	curves	are	
plotted	in	Fig.	3(c).	Here	the	THz	spectrum	(circles)	is	obtained	by	
dividing	the	detected	pyroelectric	signal	by	the	product	of	the	
width	(FWHM)	and	height	of	each	filter’s	transmission	curve	[16].	
The	resulting	spectrum	peaks	at	1	THz	and	falls	with	increasing	
THz	frequency.	We	also	observed	the	presence	of	narrow	band	
radiation	 at	 15	 THz	 radiation,	 expected	 from	 phase‐matched	
optical	rectification	in	LN	[17].	Such	radiation,	however,	is	greatly	
attenuated	by	the	10‐mm	thick	Si	window	and	completely	blocked	
by	the	longpass	filter	used	in	this	experiment.	
To	 simulate	 THz	 generation	 in	 a	 bulk	 LN,	 we	 solve	 1‐

pulse	centered	at	800	nm	with	a	FWHM	bandwidth	of	50	nm.	This	
yields	an	initial	pulse	width	of	19	fs	when	no	GDD	applied.	
Figure	4(a)	shows	a	simulated	THz	waveform	captured	1	mm	
after	exiting	a	0.5‐mm	thick	LN	when	irradiated	by	a	laser	pulse	
with	an	initial	GDD	value	of	‐1,200	fs
2
.	It	shows	two	emerging	THz	
pulses	separated	by	4.6	ps.	This	is	because	phase	matching	is	not	
satisfied	 throughout	 the	 entire	 thickness	 of	 LN.	 Instead,	 non‐
vanishing	THz	arises	from	mostly	the	front	and	rear	surfaces	of	LN	
within	one	coherence	length,	l

THz
	=	5	is	the	
refractive	index	at	1	THz,	and	n
g
	=	2.2	is	the	group	index	at	800	nm.	
The	first	pulse	at	t	=	0	ps	is	produced	from	near	the	rear	surface	of	
LN,	whereas	the	second	pulse	at	4.6	ps	is	created	from	near	the	
front	end.	
Figure	4(b)	shows	the	radiation	spectrum	(black	line)	obtained	
via	Fourier	transformation	of	the	waveform	in	(a).	The	spectrum	
agrees	well	with	our	measurement	in	Fig.	4.	The	fast	modulations	
observed	at	<2	THz	are	due	to	interference	between	two	
temporally	separated	THz	pulses.	The	spectrum	of	the	first	pulse	
(red	line)	is	much	broader	and	stronger	than	that	of	the	second	
one	(blue	line).	This	is	because	absorption	
()	in	LN	increases	
with	frequency	,	and	the	second	pulse	is	affected	more	by	this	
absorption.	This	also	explains	why	the	0.5‐mm	thick	LN	produces	
more	THz	radiation	than	the	1.0‐mm	one,	as	shown	in	Fig.	1.	With	
a	thinner	LN,	the	laser	pulse	experiences	less	energy	depletion	and	
SPM	until	reaching	the	rear	surface,	and	the	THz	emitted	from	the	
front	side	undergoes	more	absorption.	
Figure	4(c)	shows	simulated	THz	spectral	power	as	a	function	of	
laser	input	GDD.	It	well	reproduces	the	suppressed	THz	emission	
when	excited	by	short	pulses.	Through	the	simulation,	we	confirm	
that	this	is	mainly	caused	by	laser	energy	depletion	via	3	photon	
absorption,	with	little	contribution	from	THz	screening	by	charge	
carriers.	The	 solid	 line	represents	 the	 overall	THz	 conversion	
efficiency	with	all	spectral	power	integrated.	It	gives	a	maximum	
efficiency	of	0.028%,	not	significantly	different	from	our	measured	
value	(0.01%)	given	that	many	coefficients	used	in	Eqs.	(1‐2)	
largely	vary	from	literature	to	literature.	
In	conclusion,	we	have	demonstrated	scalable	THz	generation	
with	Ti:sapphire	laser	energy	up	to	2	J	using	a	75‐mm	diameter	LN	
wafer.	This	provides	THz	conversion	efficiencies	approaching	10
‐4
	
in	a	simple	setup.	The	scheme	is	easily	up‐scalable	by	simply	
increasing	the	surface	area	of	LN	with	more	laser	energy.	For	
instance,	 a	 LN	 wafer	 with	 152	 mm	 diameter,	 currently	
commercially	available,	can	accommodate	laser	energy	of	18.6	J	at	
laser	fluence	of	0.1	J/cm
2
	and	produce	output	THz	energy	up	to	1.7	
mJ.	Potentially,	contact	grating	[18],	contact	tilted	reflection	[19],	or	
echelon	step	[20]	structures	can	be	fabricated	on	the	front	surface	
of	a	large	LN	to	increase	further	the	coherence	length	for	phase	
matching	and	thus	produce	even	higher	THz	energy.

Photonic band structures are a typical fingerprint of periodic optical structures, and are usually
observed in spectroscopic quantities such as transmission, reflection and absorption. Here we show
that also the chiro-optical response of a metasurface constituted by a lattice of non-centrosymmetric,
L-shaped holes in a dielectric slab shows a band structure, where intrinsic and extrinsic chirality
effects are clearly recognized and connected to localized and delocalized resonances. Superchiral
near-fields can be excited in correspondence to these resonances, and anomalous behaviors as a
function of the incidence polarization occur. Moreover, weintroduce a singular value decomposition
(SVD) approach to show that the above mentioned effects are connected to specific fingerprints of the
SVD spectra. Finally, we demonstrate by means of an inverse design technique that the metasurface
based on an L-shaped hole array is aminimalone. Indeed, its unit cell geometry depends on the
smallest number of parameters needed to implement arbitrary transmission matrices compliant
with the general symmetries for 2d-chiral structures. These observations enable more powerful wave
operations in a lossless photonic environment.
INTRODUCTION
Electromagnetic fields which carry chirality – in their
simplest form, left- and right-circularly polarized plane
waves – deserve huge interest as they interact with mat-
ter chirality, enabling for instance to discriminate enan-
tiomers in chemistry, which are ultimately connected
with key features of living organisms.  Indeed, many
biomolecules have a specific handedness, and it is not
yet clear why nature has decided to go in that precise
direction [1]. From a more application-oriented point of
view, the pharmaceutical industry constantly seeks for
effective methods to discriminate stereoisomers, an appli-
cation where chiral light-matter interaction could prove
useful.
To date, the most common technique to prepare and
analyze chiral light is to employ birefringent plates and
linear polarizers that convert light to and from linear
polarization, as the technology of direct sources and de-
tectors of chiral light is still in its infancy [2–5].  Last
advances in nanotechnology are however revolutionizing
chiral optical devices [6–21].  Far- and near-field chiral
electromagnetic responses have been indeed observed in a
variety of artificially structured systems, where the shape
of the machined elements must have a three-dimensional
character if geometric and electromagnetic chirality has
to be attained in its most rigorous form, because of
the requirement of the absence of any mirror symme-
try plane [22–24].  Several proposed structures hence
rely on volumetric fabrication techniques, which how-
ever suffer from either scarce throughput or limited flex-
ibility. Thus, less demanding fabrication technologies –
i.e., planar technologies – may also be employed, as wit-
nessed by some reports [25–27]. For instance, a dielec-
tric film with a non-centrosymmetric partially etched pla-
nar pattern was proposed as a simple gateway towards
strong chiro-optical phenomena [28]. Nonetheless, there
is a wide interest in developing subwavelength-patterned
high-index dielectrics, both for applications and for fun-
damental research: from one side, they enable the synthe-
sis of flat lenses, polarimeters, spectrometers, nonlinear
components and computer-generated holograms [29–34];

2
from another side, they exhibit a variety of intriguing
phenomena such as Fano lineshapes, perfect forward scat-
tering, geometric phase effects, and bound states in the
continuum resonances [35–39].
Most of these effects arise from complex electromag-
netic behaviors whose essence can be grasped under-
standing the interplay between localized and delocalized
resonances. In other words, these systems often rely on
the co-presence, and on the competition, between guided
wave phenomena and antenna-like responses, as high-
lighted by the prototypical transition between the guided
mode filter regime, the photonic crystal regime, and the
independent-particle Mie-scattering regime [40]. In this
work we report on the observation of photonic bands
in a chiral metasurface, highlighting that the chiral re-
sponse shows fingerprints of both guided wave and locally
resonant phenomena. The object under investigation is
the simplest conceivable 2d-chiral dielectric metasurface:
a slab perforated with L-shaped holes [41].  Although
it is not a 3d-chiral geometric object, its finite thick-
ness allows it to implement interesting chiral electromag-
netic features such as chiro-optical far-field response at
normal incidence and the excitation of superchiral near-
fields with incident unpolarized light. The metasurface
response at normal incidence will be analyzed by means
of a singular-value decomposition approach that reveals
the operational capabilities of any 2d-chiral photonic de-
vice. Moreover, we will show that the extremely simple
L-shaped structure is also aminimalone: by tuning a
small number of geometrical parameters, it is possible
to access a very wide set of the transmission matrices
characteristic of a general 2d-chiral metasurface. In this
sense, we approached the solution of the inverse design
problem of 2d-chiral metasurfaces [42].
CHIRAL RESPONSE AT NORMAL INCIDENCE
The metasurface under investigation is illustrated in
Fig. 1a. It consists of a 220 nm thick gallium arsenide
membrane, patterned with L-shaped holes arranged over
a square lattice. The geometric parameters of the holes
are reported in Fig. 1b, superimposed to the scanning
electron microscope (SEM) image of a fabricated sam-
ple. While in a forthcoming analysis the parametersa,

will be allowed to vary, the first part of the ar-
ticle deals with a specific choice of parameters, which
correspond indeed to the SEM image. In detail, we have

sample fabrication process, whose details are reported in
the Supplementary Materials, allows to obtain a frame-
supported membrane, freely accessible from both sides
to perform optical measurements with a moderately fo-
cused (≈50μm spot) near-infrared (1 – 2μm wave-
length) beam. The beam originates from a supercontin-
uum source, filtered by means of an acousto-optic tun-

system is controlled through an automated software de-
veloped in C++. The polarization state is prepared with
a Glan-Taylor polarizer followed by aλ/4 superachro-
matic waveplate; no polarization analysis is performed
on the beam transmitted after the sample. The sample
is mounted on a rotating support that enables to mea-
sure the angularly-resolved transmittance, as illustrated
in Fig. 1a. A first set of measurements has been however
collected at normal incidence (θ= 0). The experimen-
tal data are reported in Fig. 1c, and are compared with
the outcome of a numeric model (rigorous coupled wave
analysis, RCWA – see the Supplementary Materials for
details). The spectra consist of a series of quite narrow
dips, some of them having different shapes and depths
depending on the polarization state of the incident light.

ized light, respectivelyT

: this
quantity is plotted in Fig. 1d. Here, the traces labeled
front incidenceandback incidencehave been collected
from the same sample, but illuminated from either the
top surface or the bottom surface. The traceenantiomer
derives instead from a second sample, which differs from
the first one solely for the L-shaped hole sense of chirality
at fabrication stage: the second sample, when observed
from the front side, is described by the same parame-
ters of the first sample exception made for the exchange
f

. The good matching between the CD spectrum
of the enantiomer with that of the original sample’s back
side, as well as the fact that the front and back side CD
are opposite to each other, indicates that the objects un-
der investigation are almost perfectly 2-d chiral. Indeed,
while in principle a through-hole perforated homogeneous
membrane has a mirror plane parallel to its surface, fab-
rication imperfections may have lead the actual sample
to deviate from this ideal characteristic.  The data in-
stead indicate that the two samples are essentially the
same object, from both geometric and electromagnetic
points of view.
The data reported so far indicate that a 2d-chiral meta-
surface with a very simple design exhibits strong circular
dichroism in a narrow band close to the optical telecom-
munication window. It should be emphasized that the
observed CD is not accompanied by absorption; rather,
it originates from a redistribution of the incident energy
among the transmitted and reflected beams (no diffrac-
tion is present thanks to the subwavelength dimensions
of the pattern).  In this sense, the presented object is
rather a beam splitter sensitive to the circular polariza-
tion.  However, from the point of view of an observer
who can only access the transmitted beam, the effect is
indistinguishable from dichroic absorption induced CD.
Hence, this effect can be employed to mimick the CD of
target objects such as, for instance, naturally occurring
molecules.
CHIRAL RESPONSE AT OBLIQUE INCIDENCE
AND BAND STRUCTURE
In the transmission spectra reported in Fig. 1 a rich
structure can be noticed, whose physical origin deserves
attentionper seand in view of applications. In order to
get further insight into the nature of the resonances lead-
ing to CD peaks, a powerful method is to measure the
metasurface transmittance at different angles of incidence
(i.e., for different orientations of the incident wavevec-
tor).  Angularly-resolved measurements have been in-
deed recently employed to reveal special features of po-
larization phenomena like magneto-optic effects in quasi-
ordered structures [43] and asymmetric transmission in
low-symmetry plasmonic hole arrays [44]. This approach
allows to distinguish between angularly dispersive and
non-dispersive resonances, which originate from differ-
ent physical phenomena: guided mode resonances and
antenna-like resonances, respectively. In Fig. 2 a-b we re-
port the CD mapped in the frequency-wavevector space,
where the fingerprints of the above cited mechanisms
better stand out. Here, the in-plane wavevector is the
projection of the incident light wavevector on the meta-
surface plane.  In the experiment only positive angles
have been studied, while the model data are available
for both positive and negative angles. The good match-
ing between experimental and model data allows to ac-
quire confidence in the model as a whole, which shows
interesting features.  First, strongly dispersive bands,
with positive and negative slope, suggest that the meta-
surface optical response has important contributes from
guided mode resonances (also known as quasi-guided
modes); this picture is supported by an empty-lattice
band-folding model illustrated in the Supplementary Ma-
terial. These resonances are responsible for the narrow
dips observed in the transmission spectra and for the
sharp oscillations in the CD spectra.
Second, by comparing the CD observed at opposite an-
gles, it can be noticed that in the region at the center of
the map (−20
◦
< θ <20
◦
, 190 THz< ν <210 THz)
the CD is not symmetric with respect to the exchange
θ↔ −θ. The effect can be better noticed looking at the
curves in Fig. 2c, where the CD as a function of the in-
cidence angle has been reported for three fixed values of
light frequency (labels i–iii in the figure). We attribute
this effect to the presence of a spectrally and angularly
broad chiral resonance, which we will refer to as L-hole
resonance. This resonance has a behavior that contrasts
in two ways that of the guided mode resonances: first, the
broad angular response of the L-hole resonance suggests
that it has a spatially localized nature, as opposed to the
delocalized, traveling-wave nature of the guided mode
resonances (which instead follow a dispersive energy-
wavevector curve). Second, it entails an intrinsic chiral
response: while in the outer regions of the map, where
the L-hole resonance is inactive, the CD displays anex-
trinsically chiralcharacter (CD(θ) =−CD(−θ)), in the
central region of the map anintrinsically chiralcharacter
emerges (CD(θ)6=−CD(−θ)) [45].
Seeking for further confirmation of this view, we cal-
culated (see the Supplementary Materials for details) the
optical near fields of the metasurface unit cell, upon the
illumination conditions that excite the two types of res-
onances.  The data are plotted in Fig. 2d, where both
energy density (colormap) and Poynting vector (arrows)
are reported. While the energy density distributions do
not show remarkable behaviors, the Poynting vector field
shows interesting properties that are consistent with the
picture sketched above.  When the metasurface is illu-
minated with the energy-wavevector pair labeled as A in
Fig. 2b, the Poynting vector in the unit cell has a strongly
inhomogeneous distribution: for left polarized excitation,

4
it even “winds up” around the L-shaped hole. For right-
polarized excitation the Poynting vector has a different,
yet still irregular, distribution. We interpret these irreg-
ular distributions as arising from the L-hole resonance:
a localized resonance dominated by multipoles, similarly
to the reports of Ref. [28]. On the contrary, when the
metasurface is illuminated with the energy-wavevector
pair labeled B, the Poynting vector shows much more
regular distributions, typical of a guided mode that prop-
agates parallel to the slab. Noticeably, the direction of
the Poynting vector is opposite with respect to that of
the in-plane wavevector, consistently with the negative
dispersion of the photonic band where point B lies on.
SUPERCHIRAL NEAR-FIELDS
Besides far-field angularly-dispersive chiro-optic re-
sponse, which is of interest – for instance – for filters,
holograms, and multiplexers, near-field optical chirality
plays a fundamental role in the interaction with chiral
matter. First relegated to the role of pure mathemati-
cal curiosity, electromagnetic (e.m.) chirality is now re-
garded as a crucial quantity to be taken care of when
the optical detection of chiral molecules is under inves-
tigation [46–49]. The ability of a photonic structure to
enhance the e.m. chirality is quantified by thenormal-
ized e.m. chirality, defined as

wherecis the speed of light,EandBare the fields at
the point of interest, andE
inc
is the electric field vec-
tor of the incident plane wave.  In the absence of any
photonic structure, the plane wave would freely propa-
gate and one would have
ˆ
C= 0 for linear polarization
and
ˆ
C=±1 for right (left) circular polarization. When
the incident wave impinges instead on a photonic struc-
ture, the near-fields excited in its vicinity may display a
significantly different value of
ˆ
C: for instance, one may
have
ˆ
C6= 0 also if the incident light is linearly polar-
ized, or it is possible that|
ˆ
C| ≫1 (superchiral  field).
In Fig. 3 we show that the 2d-chiral L-shape patterned
membrane has a strong near-field e.m. chirality, also at
normal incidence, and also when considering the spatial
average of

Cover a plane placed in closed proximity of
the metasurface (figure inset). In the graph, the colored
area indicates the accessible values of

structure.  Superchiral behavior occurs at wavelengths
corresponding to the spectral features observed in the
far-field transmission (see Fig. 1c).  Noticeably, maxi-
mum (minimum) values of

upon right (left) circularly polarized illumination, as it
can be observed from the corresponding traces (blue and
red curves, respectively).  Even more curiously, at the

Furthermore, a strongly anomalous value

observed atλ= 1.45μm. We attribute these anomalies
to the influence of the chiral localized resonance, “mode
A”, discussed above, whose interplay with the narrower
guided mode resonances leads to such features. In the
considered spectral region other interesting phenomena
take place. First, the metasurface displays
ˆ
C6= 0 also
when it is illuminated with unpolarized light, as illus-
trated by the trace

ity of the metasurface enables an asymmetry between
the extremal values of

.  In essence, an appropriate choice
of wavelength allows to engineer the near-field chiral re-
sponse to a large extent, as the device response breaks
certain conventional rules concerning e.m. chirality.
SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION
ANALYSIS OF THE METASURFACE
OPERATION
We now move back to the far-field metasurface re-
sponse, in the attempt to understand in a comprehen-
sive way its amplitude, phase and polarization response.
This analysis relies on the properties of theT-matrix
(transmission matrix, or Jones matrix), where the de-
vice response concerning light transmission is completely
encoded[50]. TheT-matrix can be written over different
bases; the most common choices being that of linearly
or circularly polarized waves.  In the following we will
identify theT-matrix written in these bases asT
L
and
T
C
, respectively. For instance,T
C
operates over Jones
vectors whose elements are the right- and left-handed
circularly polarized components of incident/transmitted
light:t=T
C
i, witht= (t
R
,t
L
) andi= (i
R
,i
L
).
The form ofT, and hence the possible operations that
a metasurface can implement, are dictated by geometri-
cal symmetry properties of the pattern lattice and unit
cell. For instance, the L-shaped hole structure belongs
to the more general category of objects that have a sin-
gle mirror symmetry plane, usually identified byM
x,y
where thex−yplane is that of the metasurface. Un-
der normal incidence, theT
L
matrix of such metasur-
face is symmetric:T
L
=T
t
L
[41].  However, to get a
more insightful vision into the metasurface operation we
found it useful to focus on the properties ofT
C
, in par-
ticular to its singular value decomposition (SVD). The
SVD is an algebraic operation that reveals the structure
of non-unitary linear operators, similarly to what eigen-
value decomposition (ED) does about unitary operators;
a short recall of the properties of the SVD are given in
the Supplementary Material. In the case under analysis
the SVD is better suited with respect to ED, since the
T-matrix is in general not unitary. Indeed, a dielectric
metasurface is lossless in its full response (reflection plus
transmission), but it appears lossy as the sole transmis-
sion is considered.  The SVD ofTnaturally describes
the energy-handling behavior of the metasurface, since
the square of its two singular values are the maximum

5
and minimum wave intensity that can be transmitted by
the metasurface (assuming unit intensity incident beam)
[51]. Thus, our approach goes beyond what was reported
in past studies on planar chiral metamaterials which did
not rely on the SVD [52, 53], and gives a complementary
viewpoint with respect to other decomposition methods
(pseudopolar and integral decomposition, [54, 55]) em-
ployed in polarization optics.
Algebraic manipulations (see the Supplementary Ma-
terial) leveraging on the symmetry ofT

imply that the

. We recall
that Σ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values

, which means that the metasurface performs a

basis change identified by the unitary matrixD

. Notice-
ably,D

is the matrix that describes, in the circular po-
larization basis, a rotation of the reference system about
the axis perpendicular to the metasurface plane. In other
words, the operation of anM

, that however acts in a ro-
tated coordinate system. From this fact it follows that,
in order to specify the operation of aM
x,y
-symmetric
metasurface, it is sufficient in essence to specify itsF:
indeed, the full space of transmission matrices can be
saturated by simply rotating the metasurface about the
axis perpendicular to the metasurface plane.
We now devote our attention to understanding the
meaning of the parameters entering the matrices above.
To this end one should explicitly describe the operation
ofT
C
over a generic incident field vectori. By decompos-
ing it over the basis defined by the columnsw
(1,2)
of the
unitary matrixW, one hasT

. With these expressions the metasur-
face operation can be directly visualized on the Poincar ́e
sphere, as illustrated in Fig. 4. In essence, the metasur-
face decomposes the incident polarization state over the
polarization states identified byw
(1,2)
, reverses the hand-
edness of these states (by convertingw
(1,2)
→v
(1,2)
),
and scales the energy content of each polarization state,
according to the singular valuesσ
1,2
. The location of the
polarization states is connected with the parametersψ
andθthat appear in the matrix decomposition reported
above (Fig. 4). As expected,ψis connected to a physical
rotation (a rotation in the plane of the coordinate axes
identifying thex- andy-related Stokes parametersS
1,2
).
Instead,θis directly connected with the “chiral” Stokes
parameterS
3
. In the following, we will mostly drop the
use ofθand will rather define the metasurface functional-
ity referring to theS
3
values ofw
(1,2)
:S
(1,2)
3
=±cos2θ.
To complete the picture one should also consider the
phase response of the metasurface, which is described
by the parameters
 ̃
φand ∆ that appear in the decom-
position. These parameters are connected to a relative
and a global phase, in the following sense:  ∆ identi-
fies the phase difference between theRcomponents of
w
(1,2)
, since 2∆ = arg
(
w
(1)
R
)
−arg
(
w
(2)
R
)
. Instead, the
phase difference between incident and transmitted field,
φ= arg
(
v

R
)
−arg
(
w
(1)
R
)
is given byφ=
 ̃
φ−2∆ +π.
Both relative and global phases are of practical interest,
as they allow for independent control over the phase pro-
file of both polarizations in polarization-dependent meta-
surface holograms.
The algebraic and parametric analysis performed so far
is valid at each individual wavelength. More information
can however be obtained by studying the spectral disper-
sion of the SVD parameters, whose frequency-dependent
response can be eventually correlated with quantities of
more direct experimental access. In Fig. 5a we plot the
calculated spectral dispersion of the singular values for
the L-shaped hole array described in the previous sec-
tions. In this analysis, singular values are not sorted in
decreasing order, rather, they are sorted such as their
trend with respect to the wavelength is smooth.  The
spectrum reveals a structure with narrow dips, mostly oc-
curring in pairs, which stand out of a background where
bothσ’s are close to 1 (forλ <1.45μm) or where oneσis
close to 1 and the other is close to 0.5 (λ >1.45μm). No-
ticeably, these dips occur at the same wavelengths where
the spectra of transmission, circular dichroism, and near-
field chirality also show peaks or dips. It is also interest-
ing to notice that the dips reach zero: at those wave-
lengths, the metasurface does not transmit the radiation
which is incident with the polarization dictated by the
corresponding right singular vector. Fig. 5b reports in-
stead the spectral dependence of the third Stokes param-
eter of the right singular vectors. Here it can be noticed
that theS
(1,2)
3
spectra show a large peak centered around
1.47μm: this feature clearly recalls the localized, broad-
band resonance discussed in Sect. 3.  On top of that,
narrow features, of widths comparable to those observed
inσ
1,2
, are present. Finer features, often occurring close
to the points whereσ
1
=σ
2
, have an unclear interpreta-
tion and may be connected to singular value degeneracy.
In the wavelength region around 1.45μm a reversal of
the signs ofS
(1,2)
3
is also observed.  The spectral fea-

6
tures present onσ
1,2
and onS
(1,2)
3
clearly recall what
noticed on the observables that have been studied in the
previous sections (transmission, circular dichroism, near-
field chirality): we attribute this fact to the presence of
a common ground – i.e., metasurface resonances – stand-
ing behind all these phenomena. We finally reported in
Fig. 5c the spectra of the phasesφand 2∆, which also
show a rich behavior, with rapid changes occurring close
to the zeros of the singular values. In general, the spec-
tral behavior of the SVD parameter is rather complex.
While this fact, from one side, opens further challenges
in view of a comprehensive interpretation, it also holds
promises in view of metasurface engineering: indeed, it
means that there is a wide space where the metasurface
functionality can be chosen and designed.
INVERSE PROBLEM AND METASURFACE
MINIMALITY
Provided with the SVD formalism, and motivated by
the conclusions of the previous section, an intriguing
question is whether it is possible to solve the inverse prob-
lem: given a target metasurface function (i.e., a targetT
matrix, or better a set of target parametersσ
1,2
,S
(1)
3
, ∆,
φ, andψ), does it exist a metasurface unit cell shape that
induces it? We determined that appropriately shaped L-
holes in a 220 nm thick dielectric slab with a refractive
indexn= 3.38 (i.e., that of GaAs at 1.55μm), are ca-
pable of implementing an arbitraryTmatrix of the class
pertinent toM
x,y
objects. In this analysis the techno-
logically relevant case of normal incidence is assumed.
We approached the inverse problem by choosing a large
set (120 combinations) of target parameters; the com-
plete list is reported in the Supplementary Material. By
running an optimization algorithm we have been able to
identify, for all the targets, a specific geometry of the L-
shaped hole such that the calculatedTmatrix matches
the target. It is interesting to notice that the L-shaped
hole has 5 degrees of freedom (a,f
1
...f
4
), the same as
the number of non-trivial degrees of freedom of theTma-
trix ofM
x,y
objects:σ
1,2
,S
(1)
3
, ∆ andφ. In this sense
we have defined the metasurface asminimal. We recall
that the parameterψis trivial in the sense defined in
the previous section, since it can be targeted by simply
rotating the metasurface. While the complete solution
dataset is available in the Supplementary Material, we
report here four exemplary cases.  Three of them are
of immediate and intuitive interpretation; they are illus-
trated in Fig. 6 a-c. The target objects are here polar-
izers, which are hence characterized byσ
1
= 1,σ
2
= 0.
The first (a) is an ordinary circular polarizer, the sec-
ond (b) is a circular polarizer that also imprints a phase
delay, and the third (c) is an elliptical polarizer. More
precisely, the objects under consideration are polarizers
andhandedness inverters: thanks to the special struc-
ture of the singular vectors, aM
x,y
object withσ
1
= 1
andσ
2
= 0 eliminates one of the polarization compo-
nent of the incident field, and transmits the other with
inverted handedness (see Fig. 4 and the related discus-
sion). The fourth example, Fig. 6d, is an implementa-
tion of the most general type ofT-matrices that can be
targeted by means ofM
x,y
objects: here, all the target
parameters (σ
1,2
,S
(1)
3
, ∆,φ) assume non-trivial values.
The input and output singular states are elliptic polariza-
tion states, there is a phase difference between the input
singular states, there is a phase difference between the
output singular states, and the singular values are differ-
ent from each other, and different from 0 and 1. In other
words the metasurface behaves as the combination of a
diattenuator and a retarder acting over elliptical states.
Implementing this operation by means of conventional
optical elements would require a bulky stack of layers,
which are here replaced by a simple, subwavelength film
where the operation is fully encoded in the shape of the
lithographically defined holes. One might hence envisage
ultracompact and ultralight optical components acting
over all the key parameters of light – amplitude, phase
and polarization.  What is more, the possibility to ac-
cess the fullT-matrix parameter space by means of a
simple hole-shape tuning of a fixed-thickness membrane
allows to implement space-variant metasurfaces capable
of performing more advanced operations with respect to
what is known to date [33], with possible applications
to beam shaping, holography, and cryptography. As a
final remark we highlight that the targeting procedure,
which we performed at a wavelength of 1.55μm that is
of direct interest to the telecommunication technology, is
fully scalable, thanks to the scale invariance of Maxwell
equations.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion we reported about the observation of
various chiro-optical phenomena occurring in a 2d-chiral
patterned dielectric slab, i.e., in a patterned slab that
exhibits a single mirror symmetry plane parallel to the
slab itself. Transmission circular dichroism is arranged in
dispersive bands, and shows the fingerprints of localized
and delocalized photonic resonances. It is in particular
the effect of a localized resonance that induces an intrin-
sic chiral response on the metasurface, with consequences
on the near-field chirality that shows superchirality and
other anomalous behaviors. Relying on the singular value
analysis of the transmission matrix, we identified the key
parameters describing in full the operation of a 2d-chiral
slab. We also noticed connections between the singular
value spectrum and the above cited phenomena. Finally,
we showed that the L-shaped hole structure, i.e., the most
intuitive 2d-chiral pattern, is also a minimal one, as it al-
lows to implement arbitrary transmission matrices with a

7
minimal number of parameters. This result about inverse
design may open the way towards advanced space-variant
metasurfaces that exploit in full the phase, amplitude and
polarization degrees of freedom of light.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL
Metasurface fabrication
The metasurface samples have been fabricated starting
from a GaAs wafer, where an epitaxial bilayer consisting
of Al
0.5
Ga
0.5
As (1500 nm) and GaAs (220 nm) has been
deposited. Several L-shaped hole arrays have been de-
fined by means of e-beam lithography on a 8 mm×8 mm
chip (Zeiss Ultraplus SEM + Raith Multibeam lithogra-
phy system; 30 keV, AR-P 6200 resist).  The pattern
has then been transferred on the semiconductor layer by
means of ICP-RIE with Cl
2
/BCl
3
/Ar gas mixture (Sen-
tech). To obtain the patterned membrane, the chip has
been etched from the back side with a sequence of wet
etching steps. First, a fast etching (H
2
SO
4
: H
2
O
2
: H
2
O,
1:8:1) with≈10μm per minute etch rate is employed
to thin the substrate down to≈50μm. A resist mask
(S1818) is employed in order to protect≈1 mm of chip
on the edges, thus allowing for chip handling. Second, a
slow etching (3:1 solution of citric acid in 30% hydrogen
peroxide; citric acid is prepared in 1:1 weight ratio with
water) having≈1μm per minute etch rate is employed
to remove all the remaining GaAs substrate. This solu-
tion is selective and stops when the Al
0.5
Ga
0.5
As layer is
reached. In this phase a second resist mask is employed,
in order to realize membranes of≈800μm×800μm
size.  Finally, an HF bath (50% concentration) is em-
ployed to remove the Al
0.5
Ga
0.5
As layer and obtain the
frame-supported patterned membrane (Fig. 7). During
the first two wet etching steps the chip is mounted on a
glass slide by means of S1818 resist.
Numerical calculations
The transmission matrix (Jones matrix) of the meta-
surface has been calcuated by means of aMATLABsoft-
ware that implements the rigorous coupled wave analysis
scattering matrix method (RCWA) following the formal-
ism of [56–59]. The theoretical spectra in Figs. 1 and 2
have been smoothed by convolution with a 2 nm wide
Gaussian in order to better compare them with the ex-
perimental ones.
The field plots reported in Fig. 2 of the main text
have instead been made with the finite-element software
COMSOL.
Empty lattice band dispersion
To understand the nature of the dispersive features ob-
served in the angularly-resolved circular dichroism spec-
tra reported in the main text, we performed an empty-
lattice band dispersion calculation.  First we identified
the guided modes supported by an unpatterned dielectric
slab, whose thickness and refractive index is the same as
that of the gallium arsenide slab employed to fabricate
the metasurface. The modal effective refractive indices
(n
eff
) are reported in Fig. 8a: in the wavelength range of
interest the slab supports the fundamental TE and TM
modes (TE
0
and TM
0
) and, below the cutoff wavelength
of≈1.4μm, also the first-order modes.  As the TM
1
mode has a very low value ofn
eff
, the plot reports only
the TE
1
mode. Second, we folded the guided modes in
the first Brillouin zone, according to the zero-order per-
turbation theory summarized by the equation
|k
B
+g|=β
wherek
B
is the Bloch wavevector,gis a reciprocal lat-
tice vector, andβis the guided mode propagation con-
stant (i.e.,β= 2πn
eff
/λ) [40].  Consistently with the
experiments, the Bloch wavevector is varied within the
first Brillouin zone along the high-symmetry direction in-
dicated in Fig. 8b. The resulting mode dispersions are
reported in Fig. 8c; notice that they appear symmetric
since no symmetry-breaking mechanisms are encoded in
this simple model. Despite the simplicity of the model, a
comparison between theory and experiment (i.e., between
Figs. 8c-d) shows that the overall trend of the features
observed in the experiment are appropriately grasped by
the model. This confirms that the dispersive bands ob-
served in the transmission spectra, and hence in the cir-
cular dichroism spectra, originate from a guided-mode
resonance mechanism.

Demonstration of the algebraic structure of
T-matrix singular value decomposition
In Sect. 5 of the main text we reported that theT-
matrix of a metasurface belonging to theM
x,y
symmetry
class can be expressed by means of singular value decom-
position (SVD) in a specific form.  We briefly outline
here the demonstration of that result.  First, we recall
that any complex matrixMcan be decomposed in the
formM=U
1
ΣU
†
2
, whereU
1,2
are unitary matrices whose
columns are the (right and left) singular vectors ofM,
and Σ is a diagonal matrix whose entries are real non-
negative numbers (the singular values) [60].  The SVD
plays an important role in the theory of linear multiport
lossy optical components, since the singular values are
the minimum and maximum absorption levels that the
component can implement [51].
First observation is that the SVD ofT
L
, which is a
symmetric matrix by hypothesis (T
L
=T
t
L
), can be cast
to a special form. Indeed, from the above definition it
turns out that one can writeT
L
=
 ̄
UΣU
†
, where the
bar indicate the element-wise matrix complex conjugate.
MatrixT
C
is obtained fromT
L
by the linear-to-circular
basis conversion matrix[61], i.e.,T
C
= Λ
†
T
L
Λ, where
Λ =
1
√
2
(
1  1
i−i
)
. Looking for a SVD ofT
C
, i.e., for
an expressionT
C
=VΣW
†
, it turns out immediately
thatVandWmust satisfy
 ̄
V W=
(
0 1
1 0
)
. By inspec-
tion we obtained the decomposition ofVandWin more
elementary matrices that is reported in the main text.
Complete dataset of metasurface shape parameters
needed to target arbitrary functions
In Sect. 6 of the main text we claimed that, by ap-
propriately shaping the L-shaped hole, an arbitraryT-
matrix can be obtained.  The problem has been ap-
proached numerically by defining an error function that
quantifies the distance of theT-matrix of a metasurface
with certain geometrical parameters (i.e.,T(a,f
1
...f
4
))
from the targetT-matrix (i.e.,T
targ
). According to the
matrix parametrization given in Sect. 5, the error func-
tion is defined as
error= (σ
1
−σ
1,targ
)
2
+ (σ
2
−σ
2,targ
)
2
+
+
((
S

)

)
2
+
+ sin
2
(
2∆−2∆
targ
2
)
+ sin
2
(
φ−φ
targ
2
)
and it is used in an optimization process that employs the
fminconfunction of the Optimization Toolbox ofMAT-
LAB. Notice that we employed 2∆ rather than ∆, since
it is the former which has physical significance (see the
main text). The constraints on the geometric parame-
ters are the following:a∈[0.8,1.5]μm,f
1...4
∈[0.2,0.9],
f
3
< f
1
,f
4
< f
2
.  For each target, several optimiza-
tion processes with random starting points were needed
in order to get a solution within an acceptable error level
(error<0.02).
While approaching the process of targeting arbitrary
metasurface functions, one might extract random combi-
nations of targetσ
1,targ
,σ
2,targ
,S
(1)
3,targ
, ∆
targ
andφ
targ
and solve the inverse problem. However, further analysis
on the meaning of these parameters suggests that certain
subsets deserve more relevance than others. For instance,
the combinations whereσ
1,targ
= 1 andσ
2,targ
= 1 can
be excluded from the present analysis. Indeed, this re-
quest means that theT-matrix must be unitary, and that
its eigenvectors must be orthogonal. However, following
[41], theT-matrix of anM
x,y
object has corotating eigen-
vectors; merging this requirement to that of eigenvector
orthogonality means that the eigenvectors must be lin-
early polarized. This observation implies that there is no
need to employ an L-shaped structure; a simpler rotated
rectangular or elliptical hole in a dielectric slab (or dielec-
tric post on a substrate) will be sufficient to implement
the required operation (see, for instance, the Supplemen-
tary Information of [30]).  For this reason we will not
consider the caseσ
1,targ
=σ
2,targ
= 1. Another point to
be observed is that it is sufficient to consider positive val-
ues ofS
(1)
3,targ
. Indeed, given a structure with geometrical
parameters [a,f
1
,f
2
,f
3
,f
4
] whose SVD parameters are
[σ
1
,σ
2
,∆,φ,S
(1)
3
], the structure obtained by exchanging
f
1
↔f
3
,f
2
↔f
4
(i.e., the enantiomer), will have the
sign ofS
(1)
3
inverted.
A first subset that deserve particular interest is that
where one of the singular values is zero:σ
2,targ
= 0; this
set contains polarizers. It should be noticed that in this
subset the parameters ∆ is irrelevant, since in the final
expression of the transmission matrix (T
C
=VΣW†) it
only appears in the terme
−i(2∆−
 ̃
φ)
=e
−i(φ+π)
. We chose
24 combinations of target parameters within this set, that
are reported in the table of Fig. 9. In correspondence to
each target, the table reports the values of the geomet-
rical parameters that solve the inverse problem. In the
table of Fig. 9 we labeled with the letters a-c the first
three cases considered in Fig. 6 of the main text.
The second subset that has been considered is that
where both singular values are non-zero, but not simul-
taneously equal to unity.  Within this subset we chose
96 target combinations, by allowing the target parame-
ters to assume the valuesσ
1
= 0.6,1;σ
2
= 0.4; 2∆ =
0,π/4,π/2,3π/4;φ= 0,π/2,π,3π/2;S
(1)
3
= 0,0.5,1.
We have limited the range of 2∆ within the interval [0,π]
since it can be shown that a certain pair of 2∆ andφleads
to the sameT-matrix obtained by employing 2∆+πand
φ+π. The inverse problem has been solved successfully
for all the 96 combinations. However, an illustrative sub-

9
set is reported in the table of Fig. 10, where a random
sampling of the complete dataset has been listed. Here,
the letter “d” labels the fourth case considered in Fig. 6
of the main text.  In the data of the tables of Fig. 9
and 10 there is not immediate evidence of a correlation
between the target parameters and the geometrical pa-
rameters; however, more refined data analysis techniques
and finer-grained parameter sweeping may reveal more
details of the physics behind the inverse problem. How-
ever, the study of these aspects goes beyond the aims of
the present work and may be the topic of future research.

FIG. 2. Measured (a) and modeled (b) transmission circular dichroism (CD) band structure of the metasurface. A rich pattern
originating from the interplay between guided mode resonances and antenna-like resonances is observed. The diagonal short-
dash lines represent the diffraction threshold: below thoselines the sample operates in the proper metasurface regime.By
tuning the incidence angleθthe first Brillouin zone is probed along a high-symmetry direction (see also Fig. 1 (a)). Notice
that the CD does not fulfil the relationCDθ=−CD(−θ), consistently with the expectation for an intrinsically 2d-chiral
metasurface. Panel (c) highlights this behavior, for threeoptical frequencies identified in panel (b). Panel (d) illustrates the
electromagnetic energy density (color map: green = low, orange = high) and the Poynting vector (red arrows) inside the
metasurface unit cell for modes A and B (see panel (b) for their definition) and for both circular polarization states of the
illuminating beam. Notice that in mode B the Poynting vectorfollows a well-defined direction, witnessing the presence of a
traveling wave, while in mode A it “winds up” around the L-shaped inclusion, indicating a localized resonance.

Symmetry breaking of a matter-wave soliton in a double-wellpotential formed by
spatially confined spin-orbit coupling

We consider the symmetry breaking of a matter-wave soliton formed by spinor Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs) illuminated by a two-spot laser beam. This laser beam introduces spin-orbit
(SO) coupling in the BECs such that the SO coupling produces an effect similar to a linear double-
well potential (DWP). It is well known that symmetry breaking in a DWP is an important effect
and has been discussed in many kinds of systems. However, it has not yet been discussed in a DWP
formed by SO coupling. The objective of this work is to study the symmetry breaking of spinor
BECs trapped by a DWP formed by SO coupling. We find that two kinds of symmetry breaking,
displacement symmetry breaking and bimodal symmetry breaking, can be obtained in this model.
The influence of the symmetry transition is systematically discussed by controlling the interaction
strength of the BECs and the distance between the center of the two spots. Moreover, because SO
coupling violates Galilean invariance, the influence of symmetry breaking in the moving system is
also addressed in this paper.

I.  INTRODUCTION
Matter-wave solitons have become an interesting subject of research due to their potential applications in various
fields, such as atomic interferometry, quantum information processing, and atomic lasers [1]. Experimental research
on a self-trapping soliton in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) began with the creation of a dark soliton, followed by
bright soliton and bright soliton trains [2–5]. Many studies have shownthat a cold-atom BEC is an excellent system
for studying solitons [6–10]. In particular, a stable bright soliton hasalready been shown to improve the performance
of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer compared to regular BECs [11]. Thus, the creation of stable soliton has become a
fascinating area of research.
Recently, the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with the LHY correction term has been proven to be a good mecha-
nism to generate stable quantum droplets [12–34], and the GP equation with long-range dipole-dipole interactions can
also create stable matter-wave solitons in BECs [35–39]. With the helpof spin-orbit (SO) coupling, absolutely stable
(ground-state) and metastable matter-wave solitons in 2D and 3Dfree space have been reported [40–49]. Moreover,
stable excited state solitons [50–54], gap solitons [55, 56], and solitons with novel vortices [57–62] have been reported
to be created by SO coupling [63, 64], and similar configurations have also been realized in an optical system [65–69].
However, previous studies on 2D and 3D solitons in BECs with SO coupling tacitly assumed that the SO couplings
were a homogeneous effect in the entire space. Recently, by using an external laser beam of a finite width, it was
shown that one can implement spatially confined SO coupling, i.e., an SO coupling defect, in spinor BECs in 1D [70]
and 2D [71] space. It is interesting to find that solitons are trappedand caught by the SO coupling with a spatially
confined modulation. These results imply that spatially confined SO coupling can act as a trapping potential to trap
the BECs in space.
If two of these beams, which form the SO coupling defect, are launched, an effective double-well potential (DWP) for
the spinor BECs is created [see Fig.1]. It is well known that one of the fundamental aspects of the nonlinear dynamics
in the DWP is spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), in which a symmetric state breaks its symmetry to a favorable
asymmetric state. The concept of SSB in nonlinear systems was introduced by J. C. Eilbeck [72]. Its manifestations
can be found in a variety of settings, including classical and quantummechanics, dual-core optical waveguides and
Bragg gratings, nonlinear discrete systems, nonlinear optics and other physical systems [72–75]. In particular, SSB
effects were studied in detail in BECs [76–84]. Applications of this effect, such as the design of power-switch devices
based on soliton light propagation in fibers, were proposed [85]. In BECs, the SSB of matter-wave solitons in a DWP
has been considered in many configurations but not for matter-wave solitons in a DWP formed by spatially confined
SO coupling. Hence, the mechanism of SSB in a DWP formed by SO coupling remains unclear.

The objective of this work is to study the SSB of matter-wave solitons in a DWP formed by two spatially confined
SO couplings in a 1D system. A sketch of the configuration of this system is shown in Fig. 1: spinor BECs with an
attractive interaction are trapped in a horizontal cigar-shaped potential well, and two external laser illuminations,
which form the spatially confined SO coupling, trap the BECs in their illumination area. We study the mechanism
of SSB in such a DWP and find two types of symmetry breaking, displacement symmetry breaking and bimodal
symmetry breaking. The mechanism of these two kinds of SSB are systematically discussed in this paper. Moreover,
because SO coupling violates Galilean invariance, discussing the SSB in the moving system is a nontrivial issue, which
is also discussed in detail in this paper. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The model is introduced in
Sec. II. Basic numerical results for the SSB of a matter-wave soliton in the quiescent and moving reference frames
are reported in Sec. III. The paper is concluded in Sec. V.

is the total density pattern soliton. The solution of the matter-wave soliton of Eq.
(5) is solved numerically by means of the imaginary-time-integration method [86, 87]. In addition, the stabilities are
verified by direct simulations. To study the mechanism of SSB in such aDWP clearly, we will apply the normalized
condition to the total norm of the soliton and fix the value ofDin the numerical simulations. Hence, the free control
parameters for the system are the nonlinear strengthg, the strength of the cross-interactionγ, and the distance
between the two wells,x
0
.  Here, larger values ofgand smaller values ofx
0
correspond to a stronger attractive
nonlinearity and coupling between the two wells, respectively.

are the peak values (i.e., maxima) of the total density pattern in theregions ofx∈(−∞,0) and
(0,∞), respectively. Ifδ= 0, the soliton has a symmetric density profile; otherwise, the soliton is asymmetric. Hence,
the mechanism of the SSB can be characterized by a bifurcation diagram ofδby varyinggorx
0
. The numerical
simulations find that increasing the values ofgor reducing the values ofx
0
can lead to SSB of the soliton, which
means that a stronger attractive nonlinearity and weaker couplingbetween the wells can easily lead to the SSB. The
numerical results demonstrate that the current DWP can feature a similar property as in the usual DWPs, which is

∼ −λ(x). Two different kinds of SSB, displacement SSB and bimodal SSB, arefound in this system by increasing
gor reducingx
0
. The former type of SSB (i.e., displacement SSB) breaks the symmetry of single-peak solitons by
shifting their center of mass from the origin of coordinates (i.e.,x= 0), while the latter type of SSB (i.e., bimodal
SSB) breaks the symmetry of a double-peak soliton by breaking thebalance of the peak values. By increasing the
values ofg, displacement SSB tends to occur with a smaller value ofx
0
, whereas bimodal SSB occurs with a larger
value ofx
0
. Figs. 2a and 2b show the bifurcation diagrams, which are displayed byδversusg, for the displacement
SSB and the bimodal SSB, respectively. The figures show that these two kinds of SSB are both supercritical, in which
the asymmetric branches (δ6= 0) emerge as the stable branch (δ= 0) and immediately go in the forward direction.
Hence, these two types of SSB are tantamount to a phase transition of the second kind. Figs. 3 and 4 display typical
examples of stable and unstable solitons for the two kinds of SSB, which are selected from the bifurcation diagrams
in Figs. 2a and 2b (see the points ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’ in these two panels).
In Figs.  3(a1), (a2) and (a3), one can see the amplitudes of the stable symmetric, asymmetric and unstable
symmetric solitons, respectively, which correspond to points ‘a’, ‘b’,and ‘c’ in Fig. 2(a). These soliton solutions
are complex functions that are specific to SO coupling (here, the imaginary parts is small).  Their total density
patterns, i.e.,n(x), which characterize their overall symmetry properties, are shown in Figs. 3(b1)-(b3). The direct
simulations of the perturbed evolution of the soliton, which identify the stability and are shown by the evolution of
the total density pattern, are displayed in panels 3(c1)-(c3). The reason why the phenomenon of displacement SSB
tends to occur with smaller valuesx
0
can be explained as follows. The bottom of the DWP, i.e.,−λ(x), has a ‘W’
profile, which is constructed by a local maximum (atx= 0) and two adjacent minima (atx=±x
0
). The difference
between the center maximum and the two adjacent minima is denotedby the magnitude ofx
0
. Whenx
0
is small,
the difference is also small and is not enough to modulate the density pattern of the soliton. Hence, the soliton can
maintain a single-peak profile and rest at the center when the nonlinearity is not obvious. However, if the nonlinearity
is enhanced, the ground state is created in the adjacent minima; hence, the soliton shifts its center of mass away from
the coordinate origin.
Fig. 4 shows a similar figure construction as in Fig. 3 for the case of bimodal SSB, which corresponds to points ‘a’,
‘b’, and ‘c’ in Fig. 2(b). The reason why the phenomenon of bimodal SSB tends to occur with a large value ofx
0
can
be explained by similar reasons as follows. Whenx
0
is large, the difference between the local maximum (atx= 0)

and the adjacent minima (atx=±x
0
) becomes large. If this difference is large enough to modulate the density profile
of the soliton, a soliton with a balanced double-peak structure is created when the nonlinearity is small. Then, if the
nonlinearity is enhanced, SSB occurs and transforms the balanceddouble-peak structure into an imbalanced one.
The bifurcation point,g
cr
as a function ofx
0
for different values ofγ, is displayed in Fig. 2c. A smaller value ofg
cr
implies that SSB is easier to induce. As expected, the figure shows thatg
cr
decreases asx
0
increases, which means
that reducing the coupling between the two wells can easily induce SSB. The dividing points between displacement
SSB and bimodal SSB are labeled in the curve ofg
cr
(x
0
) by the junction between the solid and the dash curves. The
figure also shows that the magnitude ofg
cr
is also strongly influenced by the value ofγ. Since the larger value ofγ
increases the effect of the total nonlinearity, the curve ofg
cr
(x
0
) with larger values ofγis lower than the curve with
smaller values ofγ. However, the figure shows that the dividing point between the twotypes of SSB does not show
an obvious relationship withγ.
B.  Moving reference frame
Unlike the usual DWP, the system in SO coupling does not obey Galilean invariance. Hence, the studies of SSB in
a DWP formed by SO coupling is a nontrivial issue. Here, we assume thestable transfer of solitons by the moving
SOC profile, which corresponds to Eq. (2) with
λ(x)→λ(x
′
),(9)
wherex
′
=x−ct. The purpose of this subsection is to determine the influence ofc6= 0 on the SSB. For convenience,
we will fixγ= 1 in this subsection.
To address this issue, Eq. (3) is rewritten in terms of the moving coordinate with the transformed wave function,

In usual DWP systems, which are realized in homogeneous space, the transformation from Eq. (10) to (11) makes
Eq. (11) have the same expression as Eq. (3), which is required forGalilean invariance. Hence, the variation in the
magnitude of the velocity,c, will not influence the process of SSB. However, in the current system, Eq. (11) does
not have the same expression as Eq. (3), and the magnitude of thevelocity,c, will definitely influence the process
of the SSB. It is necessary to mention that Galilean invariance can also be broken by applying a periodic boundary
condition to the system. With a periodical boundary condition, the moving velocity changes to a rotational angular
velocity. The SSB in the DWP system with a toroidal trap depends on the magnitude of the rotational velocity [88].
A recent study found that such a rotating system can emulate theSO coupling system [67], which reveals the internal
connection between the rotating system and the effect of SO coupling.
The SSB of the soliton can be obtained by solving the stationary solutions to Eqs. (11). The definition ofδin Eq.
(8) remains valid by replacingx
′
withx. A Numerical simulation shows that increasing the values ofccan lead to
SSB of the soliton. The reason the SSB is induced byccan be explained by Eq. (11). The last term in Eq. (11)
creates a linear mixing between the two components. The linear mixinghas the same profile ofλ(x
′
), which enhances
the difference between the local maximum (atx
′
= 0) and the two adjacent minima (atx
′
=±x
0
). The value ofcis
the strength of such linear mixing. Hence, increasing the value ofcmay reduce the coupling between the two wells,
which makes the SSB easier to induce.
By selecting different values ofx
0
, displacement SSB and bimodal SSB can be found and adjusted by the parameter
c. Fig. 5a shows a typical example of the bifurcation map of the bimodal SSB induced byc. Typical examples of
the symmetric and asymmetric solitons, which are labeled by ‘a’, ‘b’, and‘c’ in Fig. 5a, are displayed in Fig. 6. It
is interesting to note that the evolution of the unstable symmetric solution, which is shown in Fig. 6(c3), shows a
typical Josephson Oscillation [89]. Josephson Oscillation in a DWP with homogeneous SO coupling and a moving
system were report in Refs. [90, 91], respectively. This result impliesthat the current system may have potential in
matter-wave interferometry [92, 93].
Fig. 5b displaysg
cr
as a function ofcwith different values ofx

. The figure shows that an increase inccauses a
transition between displacement SSB and bimodal SSB. The dividing point between displacement SSB and bimodal
SSB can be adjusted by the values ofx

andc.
IV.  CONCLUSION
The objective of this work was to study the SSB of a soliton createdin spinor BECs with spatially confined
SO coupling formed by a two-spot laser beam. Two types of SSB, displacement symmetry breaking and bimodal
symmetry breaking, are found in the system.  Both types are supercritical, which indicates that these two kinds
of SSB are tantamount to a phase transition of the second kind.  Byincreasing the strength of the nonlinearity,
displacement SSB tends to occur when the two spots of the SO coupling are close enough; however, when the distance
between the two spots becomes large, bimodal SSB will occur, taking the place of displacement SSB. The explanation
for the transition between these two kinds of SSB is discussed in detail in this paper. SSB in the moving reference is
also considered because the SO coupling system in the moving reference frame is a nontrivial issue. The results show
that the velocity plays an important role in influencing the SSB. Increasing the velocity may not only help to induce
the SSB but also help the transition from displacement SSB to bimodalSSB.
A natural continuation of the current work is to consider this problem in 2D, assuming the BECs are trapped in a
2D plane and illuminated by two SO coupling spots. Hence, the inclusion of 2D vortices may generate more degrees
of freedoms to influence the SSB. A more challenging option is to consider the current setup in a full 3D geometry.

We analyze the physics of self-bound droplets in a doubly dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (DDBEC) com-
posed by particles with both electric and magnetic dipole moments.   Using the particularly relevant case of
dysprosium, we show that the anisotropy of the doubly-dipolar interaction potential is highly versatile and non-
trivial, depending critically on the relative orientation and strength between the two dipole moments. This opens
novel possibilities for exploring intriguing quantum many-body physics. Interestingly, by varying the angle be-
tween the two dipoles we find a dimensional crossover from quasi one-dimensional to quasi two-dimensional
self-bound droplets. This opens a so far unique scenario in condensate physics, in which a dimensional crossover
is solely driven by interactions in the absence of any confinement.
Ultracold atoms are in the forefront for probing quantum
many-body  physics  [1–3]  due  to  the  ability  to  manipulate
them using external fields and engineering both short [4] and
long-range interatomic potentials [5, 6].  Among them, dipo-
lar gases [7–9] gained a lot of attention since the first real-
ization of the dipolar Bose-Einstein condensation (DBEC) of
chromium atoms [10, 11].  The quest for systems with higher
dipole moments paved the way for polar molecules [12], ultra
cold Rydberg atoms [13], erbium [14] and dysprosium (Dy)
[15] BECs. For the first two cases, it is the electric dipole mo-
ment whereas in atomic condensates it is magnetic in nature.
Due to the potential applications in quantum simulation [16],
computing  [17],  tests  of  fundamental  symmetries  [18]  and
tuning  of  collisions  and  chemical  reactions  [19],  a  growing
interest is focusing on particles possessing both electric and
magnetic  dipole  moments  [20–24].   Although  these  studies
have been mostly restricted to paramagnetic polar molecules
[25–28], a recent proposal has discussed the feasibility of real-
izing an electric, in addition to the magnetic, dipole moment in
Dy atoms [20]. The latter is particularly important step due to
the experimental feasibilities in atom-based setups, and opens
intriguing questions about the effect ofdoublydipole-dipole
interactions (DDDIs) in quantum gases.
Due to its anisotropic and long-range nature, dipole-dipole
interaction (DDI) results in novel phenomena in DBECs [7–
9], including anisotropic superfluidity [29–31], roton-like ex-
citations [32, 33], quantum droplets [34–37] and transient su-
persolid states [38–40]. Quantum droplets have been the focus
of large attention, since they result from the stabilization due
to quantum fluctuations of an otherwise collapsing DBEC.
In this letter, we discuss the novel physics of condensates of
particles with both magnetic and electric dipole moments. Fo-
cusing on the particularly relevant case of Dy atoms, we show
that  the  combined  DDDI  exhibits  a  non-trivial  anisotropy,
which  may  be  readily  controlled  by  means  of  the  relative
orientation and strength of both dipole moments.  This non-
trivial anisotropy results in an intriguing physics for doubly-
dipolar quantum droplets. Whereas single-dipolar droplets are
always elongated along the direction of the dipole moment,
we  show  that  a  doubly-dipolar  condensate  allows  for  a  di-
mensional crossover from a quasi one-dimensional (Q1D) to
a quasi two-dimensional (Q2D) regime as a function of the
angle between the external electric and magnetic fields.  This
opens a so far unique scenario in condensate physics, in which
a dimensional crossover is solely driven by interactions and
completely unsupported by any confining potentials.

Doubly dipole potential.— Considering the two dipoles ori-

axis,  whereas  it  exhibits  a  non-trivial  anisotropy  on  thexz-

plays a key role in
the physics of quantum droplets discussed below.

indicates a stable self-bound
droplet. In Fig. 2(a) we show the stable/unstable region (eval-
uated using the Gaussian ansatz) for a self-bound droplet in
a Dy DDBEC as a function ofa
s
andα, forN=2000 and
the dipole moments given in Fig. 1(a). For a large-enougha
s
,
the repulsive short-range interactions overcome the attractive
part of the DDDI, resulting in a mean-field stable BEC. Ifa
s
is
below anα-dependent critical value (a
cr
), the attractive mean-
field interaction is balanced by the repulsive LHY correction
resulting in a self bound droplet.  Note thata
cr
is larger for
higherαsince the attractive region inV
y=0
d
(r) increases [see
Figs. 1(b)-(e)].
The properties of the self-bound droplet are crucially deter-
mined byα. In particular, whenα=0, the droplet is radially
symmetric
(
L

)
, cigar-shaped with the long axis parallel
to thez-axis [see Figs.  2(b) and 2(c)].  This is so far the only
scenario reported in DBECs [34–37].  Whenαincreases, the
effective polarization axis changes and the droplet gets tilted
in thexzplane by an angleθ
p
[see Fig.  2(d)].  The tilting is
accompanied by a structural deformation due to the change
in the anisotropic properties of the DDDI withα.L

acquires an anisotropic (L

plane. A pancake condensate withL

results forα=π/2
(γ=1) [see Fig. 2(e)]. To capture the crossover from a cigar-
to a pancake-shape droplet as a function ofα, the droplet re-
gion  in  Fig.   2(a)  is  partitioned  using  the  ratioL

/L

.   For
the parameters considered here, the pancake droplet is denser
than the cigar one [see the inset of Fig. 2(b) for the peak den-
sity of the droplet].  Although the actual condensate profile,
which we obtain by imaginary time evolution of Eq. (8) is not
Gaussian, the evaluated widths of the DDBEC are in excel-
lent quantitative agreement with the Gaussian results [see Fig.
2(b)].

self-bound droplet are obtained by linearizing the equations
of  motion  forQaround  the  potential  minimum.   The  three
modes associated with small oscillations of the droplet widths
are  shown  in  Fig.   3(a),  where  they  are  compared  with  the
chemical potentialμof the droplet.  Atα=0 (cigar-shaped
droplet) the two transverse modes correspond to the breathing
(ω

) and the quadrupole motion (ω

) of the droplet in thexy
plane whereasω

represents the axial motion.  Interestingly,
we haveω

which confirms that the droplet is Q1D in nature. Atα=π/2

(ω

) has a purelyy-character [see Fig. 3(b)] withω

become respectively breathing and

.  Excitations
reveal that more than just a structural crossover, there exists
an actual dimensional crossover from Q1D to Q2D regime as
a function ofα.  Alternatively, as evident from Fig.  1(f), the
dimensional crossover can be observed by varying the elec-
tric field strength (or equivalentlyγ) keepingα=π/2. In this
case, whenγ1 we have a Q1D droplet along thez-axis,
asγ→1 the droplet becomes a Q2D, and forγ1 again a
Q1D droplet but along thex-axis.
N-dependence.—  Finally  we  analyze  the  dependence  of
the droplet widths withN, which provide a good witness of
the  dimensional  crossover.   Deep  in  the  Q1D  (α∼0)  and
Q2D  (α∼π/2)  regimes  the  transverse  widths  are  almost
independent ofNand they can be estimated from the trans-
verse modes by analogy to low-dimensional trapped conden-
sates.   For the Q1D droplet we haveL

shown in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d).
Conclusions.— The doubly-dipolar potential exhibits non-
trivial,  yet  versatile  anisotropic  properties,  which  leads  to
new features in self-bound quantum droplets.   In particular,
as  a  function  of  the  relative  orientation  of  the  electric  and
magnetic dipole moments, the droplet undergoes a structural
crossover from a cigar to a pancake shape.  A detailed anal-
ysis  on  the  collective  excitations  and  droplet  widths  reveal
that, the structural crossover is associated with a dimensional
crossover from Q1D to Q2D regime. This offers a unique sce-
nario in BECs in which an interaction-induced dimensional
crossover can be studied in the absence of any confining po-
tentials.  Our results open up exciting possibilities for novel
quantum  phenomena  both  in  lattice  models  and  in  BECs.
Since roton excitations in elongated DBECs occur for a mo-
mentum  proportional  to  the  inverse  transverse  confinement
along the dipole direction, roton excitations in DDBECs are
expected to present a peculiar nature, especially in elongated
non-axisymmetric traps forα=π/2, due to the competition
between  two  different  roton  length  scales.   Moreover,  Q2D

DERIVATION OF ANGLES:θ
p
(α,γ)ANDα
a
The orientation of the electric and magnetic dipoles and the cones representing the regions in which the respective dipole
moments in the second atom experiences attracting interactions are shown in Fig.  4(a)-(b).  For Fig.  4(a), both the electric (g
e
)
and magnetic (g
m
) DDI strengths are assumed to be of the same strength, andαis such that there is a significant overlap in
the attractive cones.  The angleθ
p
representing the effective polarization axis lies at the centre of the overlapping region in the
xz-plane, whereas in Fig. 4(b), in a different scenario, both the dipoles are mutually perpendicular, the effective polarization axis
is along the strongest dipole direction, i.e., alongd
m
.  In any case, the effective polarization axis lies always on thexz-plane.
Below, we obtain a relation forθ
p
.
(a)(b)
Figure 5. (color online). Orientation of the electric and magnetic dipoles and the cones showing the volume where the dipole moments of the
same kind experience attractive DDI. (a) The case in which both type of DDI have the same strength and the dipoles form an angleαbetween
them.  (b) The dipoles are mutually perpendicular to each other, the effective polarization axis along the axis (z-axis) of the strongest dipole
strength. If they are of same strength the polarization axis is undefined.
Using the spherical coordinates, the total dipole-dipole potential for two particles on thexzplane (y=0) is,

which is independent ofφ. The polarization angle,θ

determines the direction along which the dipoles are maximally attractive,
and is depicted in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b). It is obtained by minimizingV

On the other hand, the angleα

separates the regime between the purely attractivexzpotential (α > α

) with an anisotropicxz
potential exhibiting both repulsive and attractive lobes.  The attractive and repulsive lobes in the potential are separated by two
intersecting straight lines satisfyingV

The equilibrium widths and the orientation of the droplet are obtained by minimizing the effective potential,V
e f f
.  Further, by
linearizing the equations of motion around the equilibrium values we obtain the low-lying excitation frequencies.

3D numerical calculations revealed that atα=0, in the Q1D regime we have a cigar-shaped droplet with almost a Gaussian
shape in the radial direction and a TF-like profile in the axial direction. Thus, choosing a hybrid ansatz of the form:

We  exploit  the  nonlinearity  arising  from  the  spin-photon  interaction  in  an  InAs  quantum  dot
to  demonstrate  phase  shifts  of  scattered  light  pulses  at  the  single-photon  level.   Photon  phase
shifts of close to 90
◦
are achieved using a charged quantum dot in a micropillar cavity.  We also
demonstrate a photon phase switch by using a spin-pumping mechanism through Raman transitions
in an in-plane magnetic field.  The experimental findings are supported by a theoretical model which
explores the dynamics of the system.  Our results demonstrate the potential of quantum dot-induced
nonlinearities for quantum information processing.
I.  Introduction
Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are considered a
promising  candidate  for  quantum  information  process-
ing.  As excellent sources of single photons, they demon-
strate unparalleled brightness [1],  near perfect indistin-
guishability [2, 3] and excellent efficiency [4].  They can
be embedded in a variety of nanophotonic structures for
enhanced light-matter interaction [5–7].  The non-linear
effects arising from the interaction between a photon and
a  single  charge  spin  confined  in  a  QD  can  be  used  to
achieve a range of quantum operations required for quan-
tum  information  processing.   To  that  aim,  spin-photon
entanglement has been recently demonstrated [8], while
other  applications  such  as  logic  operations  [9–12]  have
been proposed.
There has been a significant effort to exploit the non-
linearities arising from spin-photon interactions to realize
a quantum switch.  Proposals have been made to make a
spin-photon switch using an emitter in a cavity [13, 14].
Typically, this relies on the rotation of the polarization
of a photon coherently scattered by the single spin,  in-
ducing photon phase shiftsφup to 180
◦
.  This so-called
giant Faraday or Kerr rotation began to attract attention
in the 1980s, when theoretical proposals suggested util-
ising the phenomenon to achieve optical quantum non-
demolition measurements [15–17].  Measurements of Kerr
and Faraday rotations using QDs were not reported until
much later, with rotation angles in the few 10

range [18–20] reported on charged QD systems under a

Faraday  geometry  magnetic  field.   Significant  improve-
ment on the rotation angles were reported recently, with
rotations of 6

recorded for a QD strongly coupled to a
micropillar cavity at T = 20 K [21].  More recently, ro-
tations  of  more  than  90
◦
were  reported  for  a  QD  in  a
“bad” cavity in a Faraday geometry magnetic field [22].
A quantum phase switch using a QD was demonstrated
for the first time in 2016, using a QD strongly coupled to
a photonic crystal defect cavity in a Voigt geometry mag-
netic field [23].  While 2D photonic crystal cavities can
offer high Q-factors and integration with on-chip quan-
tum photonic circuits, they have low photon extraction
efficiencies compared to micropillar structures [24].  Fur-
thermore,  achieving  strong  light-matter  coupling  is  de-
manding,  with  limited  reproducibility  considering  cur-
rent nanofabrication processes.
Here,  we  demonstrate  a  photon  phase  switch  using
a  charged  QD  weakly  coupled  to  the  confined  mode  of
a  micropillar  cavity.   Using  a  Voigt  geometry  magnetic
field,  we  demonstrate  phase  shifts  of  80±2
◦
of  coher-
ently scattered laser pulses which, on average, contain∼
one  photon.   After  preparing  the  spin  in  an  eigenstate
[25],  we  use  a  second  pulse  to  switch  the  QD-induced
phase shift of the initial pulse ON and OFF. Finally, we
develop a theoretical model that provides further insight
into performance limiting factors.  We show that polar-
ization control is possible using a transition in a single
quantum dot [26].
II.  Concept and Experimental Setup
The  core  of  our  phase-switching  system  is  a  singly-
charged InAs quantum dot held in a B = 8 T magnetic
field (Voigt geometry) [27].  Its energy levels form a dou-
ble lambda system (Figure 4c).|G〉and|

a 2.75μm diameter micropillar cavity with the top (bot-
tom) mirror consisting of 17 (25) mirror pairs.  This in-

simultaneously to measure the
individual contribution of each polarization to the total
collected light.  As the sample is nominally undoped, we
use a weak non-resonant pulsed laser to inject a charge
with random spin into the QD. [26].  Both positive and
negative trions are created in this way, although only one
is resonant with the cavity and observed here (see Suple-
mental Material for further detail [31]).  The photolumi-
nescence  spectrum  under  non-resonant  excitation  at  B
= 8 T is shown in Figure 4d.  We observe four distinct
peaks that are assigned to the vertical and diagonal tran-
sitions, with the longest wavelength transition enhanced
due to weak coupling with the cavity mode.  The inferred
g-factor  is|0.86|(|0.18|)  for  the  ground  states  (excited
states).  These values are comparable with previous re-
ports  detailing  both  electrons  and  holes  in  the  ground

state [32–34].  It is not possible to assign a specific carrier
to the g-factors from Figure 4d and our analysis.  Since
the injected charge type does not impact the mechanisms
used for this experiment, we do not specify whether an
electron or hole is captured.  Temperature is used to tune
the long-wavelength vertical transition in resonance with
the cavity mode.  The sample is therefore held at T = 18
K.
III.  Quantum dot-induced photon phase shift
After  injecting  a  charge  into  the  QD  with  the  weak
non-resonant  laser  pulse,  we  probe  the  change  in  pho-
ton phase induced by the cavity coupled QD transition
(Figure  2a).   The  system  is  probed  using  the  “Target”
pulse  and  we  measure  the  RCP  and  LCP  components
of  the  reflected  signal  (Figure  2b).   The  RCP  reflected
light shows the cavity response and does not contain any
indication  the  incident  photon  interacted  with  the  QD
spin.   In  the  LCP  channel,  we  observe  a  modification
of the cavity reflectivity when the laser is on resonance
with  the  QD  transition.   The  observed  peak  is  due  to
resonance fluorescence and is a manifestation of the QD
phase shift.  The marginal split (∼6μeV) observed be-
tween the cavity centers recorded in the two polarizations
is attributed to the small ellipticity of the micropillar ac-
quired during the fabrication process.  We note that the
observed peak measures 10μeV in width, and is broad
compared to other publications.  Several factors may con-
tribute to this, including the width of the “Target” pulse
(∼4μeV), the Purcell effect reducing the lifetime of the
QD [11] and spectral jittering.
The QD-induced phase shift as a function of laser de-
tuning is shown in the inset of Figure 2c.  It is extracted
using the reflected RCP and LCP signals in Figure 2b.
Data are fitted with a Gaussian function and the peak of
this curve is used to obtain the maximum achieved phase
shift.  The resulting maximal QD-induced phase shift of
the “Target” pulses as a function of the average photon
number per pulse is shown in Figure 2c.  At the limit of
a  single  photon  on  average  per  “Target”  pulse,  we  ob-
serve phase shifts of 80±2
◦
.  Given the random nature of
charge initialization in our system results in occupation of
both ground states with equal probability, the observed
photon  phase  shifts  are  close  to  the  expected  value  of
90
◦
.   Intrinsic  effects,  such  as  spectral  jitter,  may  limit
the induced phase shifts [24].  Furthermore, the cavity is
birefringent, as can be seen in the different energies of the
modes, which may introduce a degree of ellipticity in the
incident RCP “Target” pulse [35].  As the average photon
number per pulse increases, we observe a decrease of the
recorded phase shifts.  We attribute this to the collected
RCP intensity increasing more rapidly than the collected
LCP  intensity  as  the  number  of  photons  per  pulse  in-
creases.   We  model  this  by  considering  the  decreasing
contribution  of  the  coherently-scattered  photons  to  the
total scattered intensity as a function of incident power
following a previously developed model [36].  We use the
measured value ofT
1
= 0.5 ns for the transition lifetime
and the coherence timeT
2
= 1 ns as a fitting parameter.
Such  a  high  value  for  the  coherence  time  is  reasonable
given the coherent nature of the photon scattering event
[36].  The result of this model is shown in Figure 2c (red
line) and is in good agreement with our experimental re-
sults.
IV.  Quantum dot-induced photon phase switch
To demonstrate a QD-induced phase switch, we intro-
duce  a  “Control”  pulse.   The  pulse  sequence  works  as
follows (Figure 5a).  The non-resonant weak laser pulse
injects a charge into the QD. The “Control” pulse drives
the diagonal|

G〉 → |
 ̄
T〉transition, pumping the charge
out of the ground state of the|
 ̄
G〉→|T〉transition.  This
pulse  duration  is  relatively  long  (7  ns)  at  a  relatively
high  power  (average  940  photons  per  pulse)  to  achieve
efficient  spin  pumping.   The  “Target”  pulse  is  used  to
probe the|
 ̄
G〉→|T〉transition, and the phase change is
measured.  Without a charge in the|
 ̄
G〉ground state, the

pulse is ON. Differences in the change in LCP and RCP sig-
nals are as a result of a marginal offset between the respective
cavity mode centers.d)Measured phase change as a function

(solid lines).
“Target” photon will not interact with the QD and will be
reflected without changing phase.  The “Control” pulse
can be switched ON and OFF, enabling control over the
observed phase shift.  As the two driven transitions are
very close (∼130μeV), extremely narrowband spectral
filtering is introduced.  This suppresses the contribution
of the “Control” pulse to the recorded signal.
The spectra for both components of the reflected signal
with the “Control” pulse is OFF (ON) are shown in Fig-
ure 5b (Figure 5c).  In the absence of the control pulse,
the  LCP  reflected  signal  is  enhanced  when  the  driving
laser is on resonance with the “Target” transition, sim-
ilar  to  Figure  2b.   Introducing  the  “Control”  pulse  re-
moves  this  peak  almost  entirely,  effectively  acting  as  a
switch and turning OFF the phase rotation.  We find the
presence of the “Control” pulse causes a 46% reduction
in the measured phase change, from 78±4
◦
to 42±8
◦
.
Finally,  we  vary  the  average  power  of  the  “Control”
laser  pulse  to  investigate  its  impact  on  our  switching
mechanism.   In  Figure  5d  we  plot  the  phase  shift  for
range of “Control” pulses with average photon numbers
per  pulse  between  0  and  940.   As  expected,  the  phase
shift  reduces  as  the  number  of  photons  per  pulse  in-
creases.  The induced phase shift reaches a steady value
of 42±8
◦
once there are 470 or more photons per pulse.
This is a far smaller reduction than expected considering
a  successful  spin-pumping  mechanism  should  eliminate
the population in the|
 ̄
G〉state [19].
To better understand the limiting mechanisms of our
photon  phase  switch,  we  develop  a  simple  theoretical
model based on a system of rate equations for the relevant
state populations.  We calculate the polarization contrast
(and  hence  phase  shift)  using  the  ratio  Ξ  =

are the populations of the|

fore and after the “Control” pulse respectively (see Sup-
plemental Material for further details on the theoretical
model [31]).  The calculated phase shifts as a function of
the average photon number per “Control” pulse for dif-
ferent temperatures are shown in Fig.  5d.  This suggests
that  temperature-dependent  mechanisms,  such  as  spin-
flip and phonon-assisted transitions are the main factors
limiting the achieved switching ratio.  In particular,  we
experimentally  achieve  a  phase  switching  ratio  of  46%
for an average of 940 photons per “Control” pulse (cor-
responding to 36
◦
phase shift in Figure 5d).  Without a
spin-flip  mechanism  (T  =  0  K),  the  same  ratio  is  pre-
dicted to be 90% (76
◦
phase shift in Figure 5d) .  This
is limited by the ellipticity in polarization of the “Tar-
get” pulse, and the non-perfect degeneracy of the cavity
modes.   For  T  =  18  K  we  obtain  good  agreement  be-
tween the experimental and theoretical values (blue line
Figure 5c).  We anticipate that experiments performed at
lower  temperatures,  or with  a higher  Zeeman splitting,
would reduce the spin-flip rate and therefore improve the
switching contrast. We also anticipate that these changes
to our system would allow us to significantly reduce the
number of photons per “Control” pulse.
V.  Conclusions
We  have  demonstrated  photon  phase  shifts  up  to
80±2
◦
at the single-photon level by exploiting nonlinear
photon-spin interactions in a charged QD in a micropil-
lar  cavity.   We  used  Raman  transitions  allowed  due  to
an  external  magnetic  field  to  demonstrate  controllable
switching  of  the  obtained  phase  shifts.   Limitations  of
the switching mechanism in our system are highlighted

Band gap diagrams illustrating the process of electron
(left) and hole (right) capture are shown in Figure 4.  A
weak non-resonant laser E
n
creates an electron-hole pair
near  the  QD.  One  of  the  charges  is  then  captured  by
the quantum dot (dashed arrow).  The charged quantum
dot transitions may then be driven by a resonant laser
(the “Target” or “Control” in our experiment), shown in
Figure 4 as E
r
.  Probabilistically, the non-resonant laser
can  lead  to  the  creation  of  both  positive  and  negative
trions.   However,  they  will  be  at  different  wavelengths
and  therefore  only  one  trion  will  be  resonant  with  the
cavity mode of our micropillar.  Hence, it is only possible
for us to see PL from one trion in our experiment.  From
our data for the electron and hole g-factors and without
being able to see additional charge lines, it is not possible
for us to determine whether we have a positive or negative
trion.  For this experiment and others based on similar
structures, the observed phenomena do not change based
on the type of charge captured by the QD.

In Figure 3d of the main text, we present the results
of a theoretic model used to gain a better understanding
of the limitying mechanisms of our system.  It is based
on a system of rate equations for the population of the
relevant states.  A schematic of the lambda system used
as the basis of our model is shown in Figure 5.  We define
Ω as the Rabi frequency of the ”Control” pulse, and Γ
1
(Γ

)  as  the  relaxation  rate  from  the  trion  state  to  the
|
 ̄
G〉(|G〉) ground state.  The transition rate between the
two ground states is given byξ.  We obtain a set of three
equations that relate the population of each level of our
model to the relevant frequencies and decay rates:

after  the  first  carrier  injection  pulse.   We  then  numeri-
cally solve the rate equation system to obtain the dynam-
ical evolution of the state populations for the duration of
the  ”Control”  pulse  (7  ns)  as  a  function  of  the  ”Con-
trol” pulse power.  We calculate the polarization contrast

before and after the ”Control” pulse respectively.  In the
absence of the ”Control” pulse the experimentally mea-
sured phase shift is 78±4
◦
(Fig.  5b).  We attribute the
non-zero polarization contrast to a certain degree of ellip-
ticity of the intended circularly-polarized “Target” pulse
[37].  To account for this, we normalize the calculated ra-
tio Ξ in the absence of the ”Control” pulse to the above
value.
In our model we use Γ
1
= 1.2 GHz and Γ
2
= 1 GHz.
The chosen relaxation rates from the trion states are typ-
ical for this kind of QD [26].  We consider a slightly en-
hanced rate for the diagonal transition as it is partially
coupled to the cavity mode.  We assume thatξaccounts
for decoherences including spin flip rates and phonon as-
sisted transitions, and is temperature dependent [38, 39].
It therefore takes the formξ=Ae

B
is  the
Boltzmann constant and A is a free parameter.  We use

z
= 400μeV (extracted from Fig.  1d in the main text).
The calculated phase shifts as a function of the average
photon number per ”Control” pulse for different temper-
atures are shown in Fig.  3b of the main text.  For T = 18
K and A = 600 MHz [41] we obtain good agreement be-
tween the experimental and theoretical values (blue line

We consider the quench of an atomic impurity via a single Rydberg excitation in a degenerate
Fermi gas. The Rydberg interaction with the background gas particles induces an ultralong-range
potential that binds particles to form dimers, trimers, tetramers, etc. Such oligomeric molecules
were recently observed in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. In this work, we demonstrate with a
functional determinant approach that quantum statistics and fluctuations have observable spectral
consequences. We show that the occupation of molecular states is predicated on the Fermi statistics,
which suppresses molecular formation in an emergent molecular shell structure. At large gas densities
this leads to spectral narrowing, which can serve as a probe of the quantum gas thermodynamic
properties.
I.  INTRODUCTION
The study of bound complexes composed of a large
number of particles lies at the heart of physics, chemistry
and biology.   Examples include DNA formed from
nucleotides,  complex molecules composed of atoms,
and nuclei comprised of neutrons and protons.  Our
understanding of these complex systems emerges from
idealized models, which are yet sufficiently complex to
contain the relevant physics. A prime example are shell
models, which underlie our description of the structure
of atoms [1], nuclei [2] and quantum dots [3].  A key
ingredient in shell models is the quantum statistics of
the constituent particles, which is fermionic for electrons,
protons, and neutrons leading to Pauli exclusion and the
concept of filled shells.
In nature, large bound complexes are often embedded
in  environments  and  reside  in  a  state  far  from
equilibrium. This presents an outstanding challenge for
experiment and theory as now an understanding of the
interplay of dynamics and quantum statistics in bound
structures becomes essential to explain the evolution
through the hierarchy of more complex structures as
system size increases.
Here we show that a Rydberg impurity interacting
with a background atomic gas leads to the formation
of a molecular shell structure in the quantum regime,
where the thermal de-Broglie wave lengthλ
T
becomes
comparable to the range of the impurity-background
gas potential, see Fig. 1.  In contrast to other shell
models, particles can be bosonic or fermionic so that the

FIG. 1.Occupation of a shell structure induced by
a Rydberg excitation in a Fermi sea.The Rydberg
electron (brown sphere) of the impurity atom (red ion core)
induces a molecular potential (dark brown) for the host
atoms whose range can be tuned by the principal quantum
numbern. As illustrated in the zoom-in to the right (blue
bubble), the potential supports bound molecular states in
various angular momentum channels that are localized in
the outermost potential well (not to scale).  These bound
states can be populated by the atoms initially occupying the
single-particle states of the unperturbed Fermi sea up to the
Fermi energy
F
(green shading). Since angular momentum
is conserved in the scattering with the spherically symmetric
Rydberg excitation, fermions must overcome the rotational
barrier to occupy thes,panddshells of the Rydberg atom
leading to a shell structure whose occupation (shown in the
inset) is determined by a Pauli-enforced Rydberg rotational
blockade.
role of quantum statistics can be explored.  The shell
structure we describe here for fermions is akin to the
nuclear shell model and arises because at low gas density
few-body bound molecular states must obey the Pauli
exclusion, leading to a sequential filling of molecular
shells.  At larger densities, Rydberg excitations in a
Fermi gas are an example for systems where quantum

mechanics and statistics can appear in surprising places:
The atoms bound in the molecular shells are localized
on a length scale that is much smaller than the inverse
Fermi momentum. One might thus expect that quantum
statistics should be irrelevant.  We find that this is
not the case. With a functional determinant approach
[4, 5], we monitor the time evolution of the Fermi
gas,  subject to a sudden Rydberg excitation,  in a
superposition state of antisymmetrized many-body wave
functions. We show that an intricate interplay of wave
function overlaps and quantum statistics leads to physics
similar to the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe [6, 7]
with an observable Fermi suppression of spectral density
containing the direct signature of many-body dressing.
The salient features of our results are:
1. Mesoscopic  Pauli  exclusion:   rotational
blockade and inhibition of molecule formation.—
Atoms bound in the Rydberg potential occupy states that
can be labeled by vibrational and rotational quantum
numbersk,l, andm.  While an arbitrary number of
bosons can occupy each of these levels, for fermions Pauli
statistics manifests in the filling of a shell structure.
Upon filling thes(l=  0) shell, the next three atoms
are placed in thep(l=  1) shell, and so on.  We find
that the occupation of the molecular shells from atoms
in a low-density Fermi gas is rotationally blocked due
to Pauli exclusion. This leads to a distinct response of
Fermi and Bose gases, and a suppression of the formation
of fermionic, ultralong-range Rydberg molecules.
2. Fermi compression:many-body  spectral
narrowing and probe of macroscopic quantities.—
At large gas densities, we find that the many-body
spectral density is measurably narrower for fermions
than for bosons.  In Bose gases [8–10], it was found
that the large extent of the impurity potential and
dressing with bound states leads to the emergence of a
superpolaronic response which can be understood from
the independence of bosonic modes. For fermions such
a description breaks down.  Instead, we find that the
competition between Fermi pressure and bound-state
formation leads to an observable compression of the
absorption spectrum when compared to the response in
a dense bosonic environment.  Being tied to the local
density fluctuations in the environment, this spectral
compression can serve as a novel localin-situprobe of
pressure and compressibility in quantum gases.  Since
the Pauli pressure is the thermodynamic manifestation
of the Fermi correlation hole, Rydberg impurities thus
present a new and controllable tool to study the origin
of thermodynamic properties on the microscopic scale.
The paper is organized as follows.  In Section II,
we discuss the physical setup of a Rydberg excitation
in an ultracold Fermi gas and introduce the relevant
microscopic model.  Then, in Section III, we introduce
a functional determinant approach that captures the
quench  dynamics  of  the  Fermi  sea  in  response
to  the  sudden  introduction  of  a  gigantic  impurity
excitation.    Section  IV  demonstrates  how  a  shell
structure emerges at various densities.   There,  we
show that a Pauli-enforced Rydberg rotational blockade
leads to suppressed molecular formation at low densities
and a compressed superpolaronic excitation at higher
densities.   We  relate  the  predicted  phenomena  to
the orthogonality catastrophe (OC) in Section V. We
conclude the article in Section VI by providing an outlook
and outlining experimental protocols to measure the
predicted phenomena.
II.  A RYDBERG IMPURITY IN A FERMI SEA
We consider a single Rydberg atom suddenly immersed
in a degenerate Fermi gas of spin-polarized ultracold

III.  FERMIONIC MANY-BODY DYNAMICS
INDUCED BY RYDBERG EXCITATIONS
Previous theoretical analyses of the interaction of
Rydberg with ground-state atoms and the resulting
molecule formation have mostly focussed on calculations
of  binding  energies,  wave  functions,  and  density-
independent spectral lines of dimers or timers [12, 16–
21].  Recent work [8, 10] introduced an approach to
study the many-body quantum dynamics of bosonic
systems.  Here, we extend this method to fermions by
combining an atomic physics few-body approach to
Rydberg molecule formation with many-body techniques
of mesoscopic physics, which allows us to accurately
capture  the  multiscale  nature  and  non-perturbative
character of the Rydberg impurity problem.

Eq. (4), also known as the Loschmidt echo, describes
the dephasing dynamics of the fermionic environment
following a quench of the impurity-bath potential due to
the sudden introduction of the Rydberg excitation in the
atomic gas. It can be directly measured using Ramsey
spectroscopy [23, 25–29].
Functional  determinants.—To  compute  the
quantum  dynamicsS(t),  we  employ  a  functional
determinant approach (FDA) [4, 5],  which provides
exact numerical results for systems described by bilinear
Hamiltonians. The strength of the FDA lies in the ability
to reduce expectation values of many-body operators
to determinants in the single-particle Hilbert space (for
details see Appendix B), taking into account infinitely
many bath excitations. In this way, the FDA allows one
to efficiently compute the many-body dynamics induced
by the Rydberg impurity in the Fermi sea, keeping track
of the full antisymmetrization of the many-body wave
functions, along with the Boltzmann factors needed for
thermal averaging at finite temperatures.
Within the FDA, the time-dependent overlap, Eq. (4),

IV.  PAULI-ENFORCED ROTATIONAL
BLOCKADE AND FERMI COMPRESSION
In the following, we expand on the discussion of
the  two  main  features  of  this  work:   a)  although
the angular momentum shells have a typical spacing
of∼1KHz (determined by the Rydberg molecule
rotational constant) and are thus not spectroscopically
resolved, it is the Franck-Condon overlaps of bound
molecular wave functions with the free single-particle
wave functions, that ultimately determine the spectral
intensity. Those overlaps are exponentially suppressed,
see Fig. 4, and lead to the inhibition of fermionic molecule
formation. We term this effect rotational blockade; b) the
quantum statistics of Fermi occupation leads at higher
gas densities to a spectral narrowing of superpolaronic
features which we interpret as a Fermi compression.
To appreciate the distinct properties of Rydberg
impurities in a fermionic many-body environment, it
is instructive to first contrast their physics to the
recently experimentally realized scenario [26, 27, 30–34]
of impurities interacting with bath atoms via attractive
contact interactions. There, if the interaction potential
is sufficiently attractive,  dimers can form.   Those
dimers exist, however, only in a state of zero-angular

momentum.   This is in stark contrast to Rydberg
impurities in a Fermi gas where, due to the large extent of
the impurity-bath interaction, Rydberg molecules form
in states of finite angular momentum.  This difference
precludes cold atoms interacting solely by short-range
interactions as a platform to study the competition
of Pauli exclusion and occupation of bound states
of higher angular momentum, essential to realize the
physics of shell structures, rotational blockade and Fermi
compression.

(solid blue) is calculated according to Eq. (6), while the
spectrum for the BEC (red dashed) is obtained using the
methods described in Ref. [8], see also Appendix D.
Even at such a low density, we observe a suppression of
spectral weight at large detuningωwhen comparing the
fermionic response to that of a BEC. While dimers, D

As  in  the  nuclear  shell  model,  the  bound-state

particles in different angularland magneticmorbitals.
As  such,  Rydberg  impurities  provide  a  cold-atom

analogue of the nuclear shell model [2], with orbitals
that can be adjusted by choosing the principal number
of the Rydberg excitation. In contrast to nuclear physics
[2], in the cold-atom setting the confining potential is
not self-generated by the particles that become bound,
but by the interaction between the Rydberg electron and
background atoms.  Therefore, it becomes possible to
switch on or off the shell-model-defining potential, and on
timescales much faster than the inverse binding energies.
This also implies that for Rydberg excitations the
formation of the shell structure is inherentlydynamical.
This allows studying the full spectrum of the model and
the non-equilibrium occupation of its excited shells.
The shell structure concept helps to unravel the
mechanisms at play in Fig. 3.  While the introduction
of the Rydberg impurity modifies the single-particle
spectrum of the background gas by introducing bound
states and affecting the continuum scattering states by
small phase and energy shifts, it conserves the total
angular momentum. Using this fact we decompose the
response shown in Fig. 3 in the variouslchannels, and
show the contribution to the fermionic spectrum from
atoms in states of angular momentuml= 0. Evidently,
this contribution (blue dotted line) accounts for most of
the overall absorption response (solid line).  In simple
terms, this effect can be understood from the fact that
atoms occupyingl=  0states in the initial Fermi sea
are the only ones with substantial spatial overlap with
the volume of the Rydberg excitation. While thel= 0
contribution accounts for nearly all of the fermionic
dimer response, trimer and higher-order lines are missing.
On the one hand this suppression arises sincel=  0
states can only be occupied once.  On the other hand,
while this argument prohibits the formation of a Tr
00
trimer, it does not exclude the trimers such as Tr
01
, that
are constituted of atoms occupying different vibrational
states, akin to the occupation of higher vibrational
orbitals in the nuclear shell model.  Compared to the
bosonic environment, even these trimer and tetramer
states are, however, suppressed.  The reason for this
finding is that by the restriction to thel= 0subspace
one does not account for the total number of fermions
in the system.  Thus, the isolatedl=  0contribution
corresponds to an effective density that is lower compared
to theT= 0BEC, whereallbosons reside in the zero
angular momentum subspace.
The remaining contribution to the full spectrum in
Fig. 3 (solid line) originates thus from fermions that
initially resided in finite angular momentum states of
the non-interacting Fermi sea.  Due to the conserved
angular momentum, these fermions can occupy states
in the molecular shell structure that have the same
final angular momentum.  Considering the extremely
small rotational constant of the Rydberg molecules, a
large number of such rotational shells is, in principle,
energetically available to the bath atoms.  Thus one
might expect the spectral response of fermions and
bosons to be similar.  Consequently, differences due to
occupation of higherlstates would only be observable
if the rovibrational energies become comparable to
the experimental resolution (which may be in reach
for lighter atomic species such as
6
Li).  Considering
this argument it is thus at first surprising that in
Fig. 3 quantum statistics does apparently plays a role
in determining the absorption response of fermions
compared to that of bosons.
The puzzle is resolved when considering the collisional
many-body physics involved:  the initial state of the

6
Fermi  sea  describes  atoms  that  fill  non-interacting
single-particle orbitals in various angular momentum
modes up to the Fermi level (for an illustration see
Fig. 1).  The higher the angular momentum of those
states, the smaller the spatial overlap of their single-
particle wave function with the volume of the Rydberg
excitation becomes.   This leads to the observation
that while the angular-momentum orbitals are indeed
energetically quasi-degenerate, the Frank-Condon factors
(FCFs) between non-interacting and interacting single-
particle states exhibit systematic variations with angular
momentum that help to explain the absorption response.
In Fig. 4(a), we illustrate thel-dependence of the

,l〉. A super-exponential
decay withlof the FCFs,  which characterize the
probability for occupying bound states from the initially
non-interacting state of free fermions, is found (see
Appendix F). This decay can be traced to the centrifugal
angular-momentum barrier and the suppression of the
non-interacting single-particle wave functions with higher
l, within the volume of the interacting bound state
wave functions, see Fig. 4(b).  As can be seen there,
the interacting wave functions are nearly the same for
differentlas they experience an effective potential that
is dominated by the Rydberg interaction.  In contrast,
the effective potential for the free fermions is solely
determined by the centrifugal barrier, which results
in non-interacting wave functions that are increasingly
suppressed at small distances with higherl.  We refer
to the suppression of absorption response asPauli-
enforced Rydberg rotational blockadesince it is the Pauli
principle that forces additional particles that could be
bound within the Rydberg orbital to occupy higherl
single-particle states, thus suppressing the FCFs.  The
Rydberg rotational blockade of the Rydberg molecular
shell structure is also evident when considering the
average occupation numbern
l
of the variouss,p,dshells
in the Rydberg orbit. Their occupation, shown as inset in
Fig. 1, requires atoms in the initial state to overcome the
rotational barrier and thus demands a sufficiently high
Fermi energy
F
.
We note that rotational blockade effects are familiar
from the collisional physics of ultracold atoms close to
their electronic ground state [35–37]. There, however, the
range of the potential is determined by the van der Waals
length,∼100a
0
, and the rotational barrier is therefore at
much higher energies. In contrast, Rydberg molecules are
created at much larger separations of∼1000a
0
, allowing
for the physics of rotational blockade to be studied in a
previously inaccessible parameter regime.
B.  Spectral evolution with increasing density
We now turn to the behavior of the absorption spectra
with increasing density.  In Fig. 5, we show spectra

F
that ranges from about0.5KHz to3KHz. As
before, the low-density response (solid line) is dominated
by the formation of few-body bound states. These result
in a series of molecular lines that correspond to one or
two background atoms bound inside the Rydberg orbit.
As the density grows, a larger number of fermions occupy
the bound states, see the dot-dashed line in Fig. 5. For
this density, corresponding to
F
≈1.6KHz, the average
inter-particle distance in the medium is∼8700a
0
. From
this, one estimates that on average about one atom is
situated inside the Rydberg orbit which for the excitation
considered in this work has the radiusR
0
≈8800a
0
.
In a classical statistical picture one would thus assume
that, on average, a single atom binds to the impurity
to form a dimer.  In the setup considered here, the
dimer has an energyE
D
≈220KHz, and hence the mean
of the spectrum is expected to occur at this frequency,
which is consistent with the result from the full quantum
calculation shown in Fig. 5.
The Fermi energy also determines which atoms from
the initial state can, in principle, participate in the
non-equilibrium Rydberg quench dynamics: it is all of
those atoms that have sufficient kinetic energy (including
atoms with angular momentuml= 0) to overcome the
rotational barrier and acquire appreciable overlap with
the bound molecular wave functions. In Fig. 6, we show
the energies of the non-interacting single-particle states

states become rapidly accessible to the Fermi atoms once
their energy crosses the rotational barrier. For instance,
for a Fermi energy
F
≈1.6KHz, see Fig. 6, atoms in
thel=  0,1,2states can overcome the barrier and
participate in the dynamics. Combining this finding with
the concept of the filling of shell structures now helps to
explain the corresponding absorption response shown as
green dot-dash curve in Fig. 5. Angular momentum is
conserved in the bound state formation. Thus, although
many atoms are available in thel= 0,1,2initial states,
at most only nine can actually become bound in the
available molecular states since then the molecular shells
ofl=  0,1,2become filled as dictated by the Pauli
exclusion principle. This is in stark contrast to the case
of bosons, for which no bound on the rotational shell
occupancy exists.
We now turn to the effect of a larger density (red
dashed line in Fig. 5), corresponding to
F
≈3.2KHz. As
an estimate, at this density, on average three atoms reside
inside the Rydberg orbit, consistent with the spectral
mean of∼660KHz found in our FDA calculation.
The fact that the spectrum extends to larger detuning
representing tetramers, pentamers, etc.  is consistent
with the Pauli-enforced Rydberg rotational blockade and
the filling of the molecular shell structure.  At this
density, the Fermi energy is high enough to populate
up tol=  3states that have a significant spatial FCF
with the region inside the Rydberg orbital. These states
then participate in the dynamics and dress the impurity
with molecular bound states.  This is reflected in the
corresponding filling ofs,p,dandfstates in the shell
structure, shown in the inset of Fig. 1, which now includes
a contribution fromf-shell states.  As can be seen in

FIG. 7.Shell structure with increasing densities.

−3
and
(b)ρ= 7.5×10
12
cm
−3
. In both cases, spectral suppression
is visible for fermions at large detuning. At large densities
an additional compression of the spectrum is found at small
detunings that originates from suppressed density fluctuations
in the fermionic medium.  The response at large detuning
[inset in (b)] reveals the formation of bound complexes of a
large particle number.
Fig. 6 and Fig. 7(b), in agreement with the relative
occupation of shell states, spectral response is now found
up to frequencies that correspond to nine or more atoms
bound to the impurity. Note that the low-energyl >0
fermions deep below the Fermi surface are still unable
to cross the barrier. Therefore, the number of particles
that can participate in the dynamics will always be lower
than that for bosons (at the same total number of atoms)
leading to a suppression of weight at large detuning; see
the discussion of Fig. 7 below.
As the gas density is increased, the spectrum evolves
from  resolved  molecular  lines  with  an  asymmetric
envelope (solid and dot-dashed lines in Fig. 5) to a

8
distribution of peaks that has a continuous envelope
(dashed line), which moves progressively towards larger
detuning.  This broad spectral response represents the
formation of Fermi superpolarons, the fermionic analog
of superpolarons formed in Bose-Einstein condensates
[8–10].  In Fig. 7, we compare the spectrum of Fermi
and Bose Rydberg superpolarons at large densities. As
evident from Fig. 7(a), compared to bosons, Fermi
statistics leads to a reduced spectral weight at large
detuning due to the suppression of Franck-Condon
overlaps for states of higher angular momentuml.  As
the density is, however, further increased, a spectral
suppression is observed not only at large but also at small
detuning, see Fig. 7(b).
This effect can be understood as follows:  for ideal
bosons, the positions of particles are independent of each
other and follow a Poisson distribution.  In contrast,
quantum  statistics  imprints  intrinsic  density-density
correlations onto fermions — prominently visible as a
correlation-hole at small particle separation — that make
them less compressible than bosons. The consequently
reduced density fluctuations in the background gas then
directly imply a suppressed spectral response both at
large and small detuning.  As an example, consider
the case where a five-particle complex has the largest
spectral weight.  In the Bose gas, fluctuations in the
medium will strongly contribute to the spectral weight
of four- and six-body complexes. But for fermions these
contributions are weaker due to the suppressed density
fluctuations, leading to a compression in the spectral
response of fermions both at large and small detuning.
The observation of spectral compression can thus serve
as a local probe of the compressibility of the many-body
environment.
While  the  suppression  at  small  detuning  can
qualitatively be understood in the simple picture of
density fluctuations, capturing this effect quantitatively
presents a challenge for theoretical approaches.   In
particular variational wave functions in terms of a
perturbative expansion in particle-hole excitations [38,
39] or vertex expansions in diagrammatic approaches
[40–42], that were successfully applied in the description
description of many conventional impurity problems,
are bound to fail to capture the physics of Rydberg
impurities in a Fermi gas, due to their limitation in
capturing the excitation of a large number of particle-
hole excitations. In contrast the functional determinant
approach can describe this system as it allows accounting
for an arbitrary number of atoms transferred from the
initial Fermi sea into the molecular shell structure, while
keeping track of the full anti-symmetrization and thus the
correct spatial nodal structure of the many-body wave
function.
V.  RELATION TO ANDERSON
ORTHOGONALITY CATASTROPHE
The Anderson orthogonality catastrophe (OC) refers
to the response of a Fermi gas to the introduction of a
localized impurity [6], where the generation of an infinity
of particle-hole excitations leads to a new fermionic
ground state that is orthogonal to the Fermi sea in
absence of the impurity.  This scenario was originally
considered in the context of the X-ray absorption spectra
in metals [22, 43], where it is manifest in characteristic
threshold singularities and a power-law decay of the
impurity Green’s function in the time domain [7]. More
recently, signatures of the OC in the time domain have
been shown to be accessible in Ramsey interference
experiments of impurities in ultracold fermions controlled
by Feshbach resonances [23, 25, 26].
So far efforts to realize the physics of the OC in
ultracold atoms [23–26], following the observation of
mobile Fermi [31–34] and Bose polarons [44–46], have
focused on systems where the impurity interacts with
the Fermi gas via contact interactions that can support
at most a single bound state.   Realistic solid-state
systems, such as quantum dots realized in semiconductor
devices, go beyond this regime.   In these systems,
multiple electrons can be bound and the response of
the Fermi environment of charge carriers can be probed
through transitions between electronic states.  These
transitions lead to features characteristic of the OC,
such as power-law edges in photoluminescence [47] and
electron tunneling [48–50]. While the Coulomb blockade
limits the number of electrons that can occupy bound
states in quantum dots, Rydberg impurities allow access
to a regime where large multi-body bound complexes are
formed in the presence of a fermionic environment.
In this work we focused specifically on the spectral
signatures of molecular bound states. However, in our
theoretical approach the creation an infinite number of
low-energy particle-hole excitations close to the Fermi
surface is also accounted for [5, 24] which lead to
asymmetric wings attached to each molecular peak. The
existence of these molecular absorption edges opens a
new avenue to study the OC in regimes where the
perturbing potential permits multiple occupation of
bound states.   Unlike in quantum dots,  the direct
interaction between fermions can be tuned or entirely
eliminated. Moreover, without direct interactions — the
case we consider in the present work — the molecular
peaks are inherentlyexcitedstates of the system, a
scenario that goes beyond limitations of previous studies
in ultracold atomic and solid-state systems.
It is believed that in dimensions higher than one, a
finite impurity recoil leads to the disappearance of the
OC [51]. An interesting question in the context of finite-
mass Rydberg excitations is whether large impurity-
bound molecules exhibit a crossover from quasiparticle
to OC behavior.  The mass of larger complexes grows
fast and should scale linearly with the number of atoms

9
bound to the impurity. Thus larger complexes may show
a sharp OC behavior, while smaller ones may exhibit
quasiparticle properties. This argument also implies that
our approach to infinitely heavy impurities may in fact
be a reasonable starting point to describe large molecular
polarons even in the regime where the impurity mass is
finite. This unusual behavior makes Rydberg excitations
a unique setting for exploring OC physics, which so far
has been challenging in Feshbach-coupled quantum gases
for which recoil effects are significant [26].
Furthermore, since the interaction range varies with
the principal numbernasr

m, the
energy and the size of the molecular states can be
tuned to the different regimes of dynamics. Along with
control over temperature and gas density, this opens a
door to many compelling questions, such as whether
the exchange of medium fluctuations may lead to a
hybridization of bound states and whether the OC has
an observable effect on the hybridization dynamics.
VI.  CONCLUSION
We describe a platform to study multiscale quantum
impurity effects in a Fermi sea.   To this end,  we
have developed a time-dependent many-body formalism
based on functional determinants that treats the bound
Rydberg molecules and scattering states on the same
footing, to follow the non-equilibrium time evolution of
the degenerate Fermi gas interacting with a spatially
extended Rydberg impurity. Accounting for all angular
momentum contributions,  we predict the absorption
spectrum and demonstrate that the spectroscopy of
Rydberg  excitations  allows  probing  the  physics  of
quantum impurities interacting with a Fermi gas in a
regime where the impurity itself may extend over to
nearly the system size.
The analysis of the absorption spectra reveals the
emergent effect of a Pauli-enforced Rydberg rotational
blockade  that  inhibits  the  formation  of  trimers,
tetramers, and higher-order oligomer molecules. While
blockade effects are at play in the formation of fermionic
ultracold Feshbach molecules [37], there, the rotational
barriers are at much higher energies.  In contrast, by
virtue of the fact that Rydberg molecules are created at
enormous distances, their rotational barriers are but a
small fraction of the binding energies so that the physics
of rotational blockade can be studied in a previously
inaccessible regime.
At low densities of the environment, the absorption
response reveals a new shell structure where fermions
subsequently fill shells that are defined by angular
momentum and vibrational quantum numbers.  In the
many-body regime at large densities our findings deviate
from the expectation that, for such macroscopic fermion
systems, the spectral response should resemble that of a
Rydberg impurity in a Bose gas. Instead we find that
the macroscopic occupation of angular momentum shell
modes results in a Fermi superpolaronic response whose
signature is a spectral narrowing (Fermi compression)
compared to the response in a bosonic gas, which can
serve as a local probe of the density-density correlations
of the many-body environment, complementing probes of
transient dynamics in quantum gases [52].
The evolution from few- to many-body behavior
involves bound-state physics in the presence of an
environment  that  goes  beyond  condensed  matter
realizations, such as phonon-induced binding of Cooper
pairs  [53]  or  trion  formation  in  presence  of  a
charge-carrier environment in doped two-dimensional
semiconductors [54, 55].  In particular, the exquisite
control over Rydberg excitation represents a novel knob
for structuring the local density surrounding the Rydberg
atoms and permits study of the interplay between
non-perturbative, few- and many-body effects in Fermi
systems.
Experimental realization.—To realize the physics
of Fermi superpolarons and study the suppression of
molecule formation, experiments with mass-imbalanced
Bose-Fermi or Fermi-Fermi mixtures featuring a low
density of a heavy atomic species in a background Fermi
gas of lighter atoms are ideal. Starting from impurities
initially in their atomic ground state, a laser transition
implements the sudden quench of the impurity potential
seen by the atoms in the Fermi sea that are initially
uncorrelated to the impurity atom.  In order to avoid
blockade effects and to gain access to the linear response
regime one can use an excitation pulse of sufficiently low
power [9].
Alternatively,   one  may  also  employ  Rydberg
excitations in a single-component Fermi gas.  Indeed,
first evidence of the Fermi suppression discussed in this
work have recently been observed in a non-degenerate
gas of
87
Sr [56].  In such a setup, a laser excites a
fermion from the single-component Fermi gas to a
highly excited Rydberg state. Since the initial state of
the Fermi gas corresponds to a Slater determinant, it
exhibits density-density correlations with a characteristic
correlation hole at short distances. This correlation hole
leaves its trace in a suppression of the formation rate of
dimers, as the Rydberg excitation is created from the
Fermi gas itself. While this effect significantly influences
the absorption signal of dimers relative to the scenario
of a two-component gas studied in this work, in the
limit of large densities the two scenarios will not differ
significantly since the initial correlations of the Rydberg
impurity and the bath become increasingly irrelevant.
In consequence, single-component quantum gases will
also realize the physics of Fermi superpolarons and
suppressed molecular formation discussed in this work.
We note that in the present work we have focused
on the zero temperature response. Our results extend,
however, to finite temperatures less than the Fermi
temperature,i.e.in the range∼25-150nK for the
densities studied in this work. This temperature range
can be further increased by employing a fermionic species

10
of a small mass such as atomic
6
Li.
Outlook.—The presented results are exact for a
localized impurity and approximate for heavy,  but
mobile impurities.   For infinitely heavy impurities,
the orthogonality catastrophe governs the many-body
dynamics and quasiparticles are absent due to the
generation  of  an  infinite  number  of  particle-hole
excitations. For a finite-mass impurity, the energy cost of
impurity recoil suppresses these low-energy fluctuations
leading to a finite quasiparticle weight of Fermi polarons
[51, 57].   Moreover,  for impurities interacting with
the environment via short-range interactions, impurity
recoil leads to a transition between a polaron and a
molecular ground state [58–60]. In the case of Rydberg
impurities, the consequences of a finite impurity mass
are currently unknown.  In which way Fermi polarons
form, and whether polaron-to-molecule transitions can
occur are open questions.   Additionally,  since the
multi-body  bound  molecules  are  inherently  excited
states of the many-body system, the question arises
whether impurity motion can potentially lead to recoil-
induced decay between the different molecular states,
rendering them unstable.   While these effects can
be experimentally addressed by exploiting the long
coherence times accessible with current technologies,
their theoretical investigation requires new many-body
approaches that can capture the multiscale nature of
Rydberg impurities as well as their motion.

We studied the scattering problem of two atoms with unequal mass, where one atom (atomα)
is trapped in a quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) tube and the other one (atomβ) is localized by a
3D harmonic trap.  We show that in such a system if atomαis much heavier thanβ, confinement-
induced resonance (CIR) can appear when the 3D scattering lengtha
s
of these two atoms is much
smaller  than  the  characteristic  lengths  (CLs)  of  the  confinements,  for  eithera
s
>0  ora
s
<0.
This  is  quite  different  from  the  usual  CIRs  which  occurs  only  whena
s
is  comparable  with  the
CL  of  confinement.   Moreover,  the  CIRs  we  find  are  broad  enough  that  can  serve  as  a  tool  for
the  control  of  effective  inter-atomic  interaction.   We  further  show  the  mechanism  of  these  CIRs
via the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.  Our results can be used for the realization of strongly-
interacting systems with ultracold atoms with weak 3D background interaction (i.e., smalla
s
), e.g.,
the realization of ultracold gases with strong spin-dependent interaction at zero magnetic field.
I.  INTRODUCTION
One important advantage of the quantum simulation
with  ultracold  atomic  gases  is  that  in  such  a  system
the inter-atomic interaction can be efficiently controlled.
The most widely-used technique for this control is mag-
netic Feshbach resonance (MFR) [1, 2].  In addition, the
confinement-induced resonance (CIR) is also a powerful
tool,  with  which  one  can  tune  the  interaction  between
trapped ultracold atoms by changing the geometric pa-
rameters of the confinements [3–12].
In  most  cases,  when  a  CIR  occurs  the  characteristic
length  (CL)  of  the  confinement  should  be  comparable
with the scattering lengtha
s
of the two atoms in three-
dimensional (3D) free space.  For instance, as shown by
M. Olshanii, the CIR condition for two atoms in a quasi-
1D tube with a CLa
⊥
isa
⊥
/a
s
≈1.4603···[3].  It makes
sense  because  a  “resonance”  usually  appears  when  the
values of several characteristic parameters of the system
are similar with each other.  Nevertheless,  for the opti-
cal confinements realized in current experiments, the CLs
are usually larger than 1000a
0
witha
0
being the Bohr’s
radius,  while  for  almost  all  kinds  of  cold  atoms|a
s
|is
below (or about) 200a
0
in the absence of magnetic field
(B=  0).   As  a  result,  to  realize  a  CIR  one  has  to  re-
sort to the MFR to enhance the value ofa
s
.  So far the
only  exception  is  the  CIR  of
173
Yb  atoms  featured  by
an extremely large background scattering length (about
2000a
0
) [13].
Therefore, it is natural to ask if the above limitation
can be broken or not.  Specifically, can an “exotic” CIR
which satisfies the following two conditions be realized ?
(i) The CIR can occur when the CLs of the confine-
ments  are  much  larger  than  the  scattering  length

|a
s
|.
(ii) The CIR is broad enough so that it can be used as
an efficient tool for the control of effective interac-
tion between ultracold atoms.
Various interesting phenomena may benefit from such an
“exotic” CIR. For instance,  this CIR can occur at zero
magnetic  field  (B=  0),  for  which  different  atomic  hy-
perfine states are degenerate, and thus the inelastic scat-
tering processes between hyperfine spin channels are en-
ergetically  permitted  [14,  15].   Using  this  CIR  one  can
control  these  processes  and  then  realize  systems  with
strong inter-atomic spin-spin interaction, e.g., the spin-
exchange interaction, which are important for the quan-
tum  simulation  of  the  Kondo  effect  or  other  magnetic
effects [16–23].  Notice that these spin-spin interactions
cannot be controlled via an usual MFR because the in-
elastic  scattering  processes  are  energetically  suppressed
by  the  Zeeman-energy  gap  between  different  hyperfine
channels, which is induced by the magnetic field applied
to induce the MFR [24].  In addition,  such an “exotic”
CIR can be realized without the help of magnetic field.
Thus,  the  magnetic  field  can  be  reserved  for  purposes
other  than  the  control  of  inter-atomic  interaction,  e.g.,
the trapping of atoms in atom chip [25].  Moreover, since
this CIR can occur for small 3D scattering lengtha
s
, as
shown below, the collisional losses may be suppressed.
In previous researches it has been demonstrated that
for the ultracold gases withnegative3D scattering length
a
s
(i.e.,a
s
<0),  an  “exotic”  CIR  which  satisfies  the
conditions (i) and (ii) can be realized in two cases, i.e.,
the scattering between two atoms in a 3D isotropic square
optical lattice [9–11], and the scattering between a heavy
atom  freely  moving  in  the  3D  space  and  a  light  atom
localized in a 3D harmonic trap [12].  Nevertheless,  for
most species of ultracold atoms in current experiments we
havea
s
>0 forB= 0.  To our knowledge, the “exotic”
CIR which can occur for botha
s
>0 anda
s
<0 has not
been discovered before.

In this manuscript, we propose that such an “exotic”
CIR can be realized for a mixed-dimensional ultracold gas
with eitherpositiveornegative3D scattering lengtha
s
.
Explicitly,  we  consider  the  scattering  between  an  atom
(atomα) moving in a quasi-1D confinement and another
atom (atomβ) localized in a 3D harmonic trap, and thus
behaves  as a  quasi-0D impurity (Fig.  1).  We  find  that
in such an “quasi-(1+0)D” system a CIR which satisfies
all the two conditions (i) and (ii) can occur when atom
αis much heavier than the atomβ, for eithera
s
>0 or
a
s
<0.
We  further  explain  the  mechanism  of  the  “exotic”
CIRs in our system with an analysis based on the Born-
Oppenheimer approximation (BOA). Explicitly, we find
that the “exotic” CIR of our system mainly results from
both of the following two facts:
(A): As specified by the BOA, the heavy atomαcan
experience an effective 1D finite-range potentialV
eff
(z
α
)
along the axial direction of the quasi-1D confinement (the
z-direction),  which  is  indued  by  the  light  atomβ.   In
addition,  for  the  cases  with  small|a
s
|,V
eff
(z
α
)  is  pro-
portional to the intensity of the 3D Huang-Yang pseudo
potential between the atomsαandβ, i.e.,a
s
/μ, withμ
being  the  reduced  mass  of  these  two  atoms.   Thus,  for
a system with given mass of atomα, when the atomβ
is very light, i.e.,αis much heavier thanβ, the reduced
massμbecomes very small.  As a result, although|a
s
|is
small, the effective potentialV
eff
(z
α
) for atomαcan still
be strong.
(B) Whena
s
>0,V
eff
(z
α
) is a 1D finite-range purely-
repulsive  potential,  i.e.,  a  1D  potential  barrier.   Intu-
itively speaking, there should be no resonance in such a
system,  because  there  is  no  bound  state.   However,  we
show that a low-energy scattering resonance can still ap-
pear when the height ofV
eff
takes some certain values.
We also illustrate this effect with an analytically-solvable
1D square-barrier model.  As a result of this effect, when
one tuneV
eff
via the CLs of the confinements, an CIR can
be induced.  On the other hand,  whena
s
<0,V
eff
(z
α
)
is  a  1D  attractive  potential  well  with  the  depth  being
dependent on the CLs of the confinements.  Thus,  it is
quite natural that a CIR can be induced when one tune
the depth ofV
eff
(z
α
) to some certain value by changing
the CLs of the confinements.
Our  results  are  helpful  for  realizing  strong  effective
inter-atomic interaction of ultracold atoms in an quasi-

either spin-dependent or spin-independent.  Such a sys-
tem  can  be  used  for  the  study  of  Kondo  physics  [19–
21, 26–28], quantum open system [29] and precision mea-
surement [30, 31].  In addition, our result also show the
existence of the broad CIRs for smallpositive3D scat-
tering length, and thus implies the possibility of finding
such CIRs in more other confinements.
The remainder of this manuscript is organized as fol-
lows.   In  Sec.   II  we  solve  the  quasi-(1+0)D  scattering
problem of two atoms with unequal mass and show the
appearance of the “exotic” CIRs.  In Sec.  III we explain

lar, we show that in the 1D cases a low-energy scattering
resonance can be induced by a purely-repulsive potential
barrier.  A summary of our results is given in Sec.  IV. In
the appendix we show some details of our calculation.
II.  “EXOTIC” CIR IN QUASI-(1+0)D SYSTEM
In this section we first introduce the quasi-(1+0)D sys-
tem studied in this work, and then give the definition of
CIR for our system.  After that we illustrate our numeri-
cal results which show that “exotic” CIRs, which satisfy
the conditions (i) and (ii) in Sec.  I, can appear in our
system, for eithera

A.  System and Hamiltonian
As shown in Fig. 1, we consider the two-body problem
with a heavy atomαand a light atomβ.  The atomαis
moving in a quasi-1D confinement along thez-direction
(axial direction) which is described as a 2D isotropic har-
monic  potential  with  frequencyω
⊥
in  thex−yplane
(transverse plane), and atomβis trapped in a 3D har-
monic potential with frequenciesω
xy
andω
z
in thex−y
plane andz-direction, respectively.  For simplicity, here
we assume the confinements of atomsαandβhave the
same transverse frequencies, i.e.,ω
xy
=ω
⊥
.  Our results
can be directly generalized to case withω
xy
6=ω
⊥
.
As  a  result  of  the  above  assumptionω
xy
=ω
⊥
,  the
transverse relative motion of these two atoms can be de-
coupled from their center-of-mass motion.  Thus, in the
two-body problem we can ignore the center-of-mass mo-
tion in thex- andy-directions.  Therefore, the Hamilto-
nian for this system is

B.  Low-energy scattering and CIR
In  this  manuscript  we  consider  the  low-energy  scat-
tering between atomsαandβwhich are in the ground
stateφ

and the ground stateφ

respectively.  Thus, the incident state for the scattering
problem can be expressed as

functions  of  the  3D  scattering  lengtha

as  well  as  the

In other words, we have

).(15)
Furthermore,  when  the  confinement  CLsa
⊥
anda
z
take some particular values, we may have
a
e
= 0,(16)
and thus the low-energy even-wave scattering amplitude
f
(e)
(k)  can  be  maximally  enhanced,  i.e.,|f
(e)
(k)| ≈1.
This is called as the even-wave CIR. Similarly,  we may
havea
o
=∞for  some  other  particular  values  ofa
⊥
anda
z
.  As a result, the odd-wave scattering amplitude
f
(o)
(k)  is  maximally  enhanced  (|f
(o)
(k)| ≈1).   This  is
called as the odd-wave CIR [32].
In  many  practical  cases,  if  the  system  is  not  in  the
region  of  an  odd-wave  CIR,  one  can  neglect  the  odd-
wave scattering amplitudef
o
(k).  In this work we only
consider these cases and focus on the even-wave CIRs.
The  physical  meaning  of  the  even-wave  CIRs  of  our
cases (i.e., the cases where the odd-wave scattering can
be neglected) can also be understood as follows.  In the
low-energy case, when the two atoms are far away from
each other the transverse motion of the two atoms and
the axial motion of the atomβare frozen in the ground
state  of  the  corresponding  confinements.   As  a  result,
our system system can be described by a simple pure-1D
effective model for the axial motion of atomα, with the
effective Hamiltonian [33]

A  straightforward  calculation  shows  that  the  effective
potentialV
(eff)
(z

) can reproduce the low-energy even-
wave  scattering  amplitudes  given  by  the  exact  “quasi-
1D+quasi-0D” HamiltonianH, i.e.,f
(e)
(k) given by Eqs.
(12),  and  the  odd-wave  scattering  amplitude  given  by
this effective potential is zero.  It is clear that when an
even–wave CIR occurs (i.e.,a
e
= 0), the corresponding
effective interaction intensityg
(even)
would be enhanced
to infinity.  In addition, when the system is in the region
around a CIR point, one can controlg
(even)
by changing
the confinement CLsa
⊥
anda
z
.
C.  The “exotic” even-wave CIRs
Now we study the even-wave CIRs of our system.  To
this  end,  we  should  calculate  the  even-wave  scattering
lengtha
e
or the effective interaction intensityg
(even)
de-
fined in Eq.  (18).  We adopt the theoretical approach in
our previous work where CIRs for cases withm
α
=m
β
are studied [21].  The details of this method is presented
in Appendix A.
In Fig. 2 we showg
(even)
as a function ofa
⊥
/a
s
, for the
cases with different mass ratiom
α
/m
β
, witha
z
/a
⊥
= 1
(Fig. 2(a-d)) anda
z
/a
⊥
= 1.5 (Fig. 2(e-h)).  It is clearly
shown  that  in  each  case  multiple  CIRs  can  appear  for
eithera
s
>0 ora
s
<0.  As pointed out in our previous
work,  that  is  due  to  the  coupling  between  the  relative
and  center-of-mass  of  the  two  atoms  in  thez-direction
[12, 20, 21, 34, 35].
Furthermore, the two broadest CIRs are located at the
higher  and  lower  ends  ofa
⊥
/a
s
,  which  are  denoted  as
CIR
(R)
even
and CIR
(L)
even
in Fig. 2, respectively.  More impor-
tantly, as shown in Fig. 2, when the mass ratiom
α
/m
β
is increased, the broad CIRs
(R)
even
and CIR
(L)
even
are rapidly
shifted to the places with larger|a

whena

tions of CIR

and CIR
(R)
even
are illustrated as functions
of  the  he  confinement  aspect  ratioa
z
/a
⊥
for  different
mass ratiom

.  In addition, Fig. 3 also shows that
for a fixed mass ratio, whena
z
/a
⊥
is larger, CIR
(R)
even
and
CIR
(L)
even
can appear for larger|a
⊥
/a

|.
According  to  our  above  results,  when  the  mass  ratio
m
α
/m
β
of the two atoms is large enough,  CIR
(R)
even
and
CIR
(L)
even
can occur when the confinement CLsa

are much larger than|a

<0, respec-
tively.  Namely the condition (i) in Sec.  I can be satisfied
by these two CIRs.
Now  we  study  the  broadness  of  the  CIR
(R)
even
and
CIR
(L)
even
.    We  first  consider  CIR
(L)
even
which  occurs  for
a
s
<0.  As illustrated in Fig. 2 (h), we define the width
W
L
of this CIR as the distance between the position of
CIR
(L)
even
and  the  nearest  zero-crossing  point  ofg
(even)
.

, wherel

.  Sincea

withI

being the
intensity  of  the  laser  beam  which  creates  the  1D  tube,
we know that to tuneg

one require to varyI

in
the region between∼0.24I

and∼2.86I

, withI
∗
being
the  laser  intensity  corresponding  toa

.   This  re-
gion is large enough for the current experiments and the
fine-tuning of laser intensity is not required.  Therefore,
CIR
(L)
even
is broad enough for the experimental control.
On  the  other  hand,  as  shown  in  Fig.  2,  the  CIR
(R)
even
which  occurs  fora

CIR

one
can realize strong attractive or repulsive effective inter-
action  between  the  two  atoms,  even  if  3D  scattering

III.  ANALYSIS BASED ON THE BOA
In the above section we show that for our quasi-(1+0)D
system CIRs can appear when the 3D scattering length is
much smaller than the confinement CLs.  In this section
we qualitatively explain the appearance of these “exotic
CIRs” with an analysis based on the BOA.
As shown above,  for our system the atomαis much
heavier  than  the  atomβ,  i.e.,m
α
m
β
.   Therefore,
the mass of atomαis also much larger than the reduced
massμof the two atoms, which is the effective mass of the
two-atom relative motion.  Consequently, both of the co-
ordinatez
β
of the atomβand the transverse coordinate
ρof the two-atom relative motion are the “fast variable”
of our system, while the coordinatez
α
of atomαis the
only  “slow  variable”.   Therefore,  in  the  spirit  of  BOA,
the  axial  motion  of  atomαis  governed  by  an  effective
1D Hamiltonian

thermore, since the 3D scattering lengtha

is very small,
i.e., the bare interactionV(r) in Eq.(7) is very weak, we
can treatV(r) as a first-order perturbation in the calcu-

We first consider the case witha
s
<0.  Eq.  (20) shows
that in this caseV
eff
(z
α
) is a 1D finite-range potential well
which is determined by the confinement CLs{a
z
,a
⊥
}, as
well as the factora
s
/μ. Therefore, no matter how small is
the 3D scattering lengtha
s
, if the reduced massμis small
enough (i.e., the mass ratiom
α
/m
β
is large enough), the
factor|a
s
|/μcan  always  be  large  enough.   Namely,  the
potential wellV
eff
(z
α
) can always be deep enough so that
the 1D even-wave scattering resonance can appear (i.e.,
the even-wave scattering length can become zero).  Thus,
as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3(b), whenm
α
/m
β
becomes
larger, the CIRs can occur for smallera
s
.  On the other
hand, when the ratioa
s
/μis fixed, the shape ofV
eff
(z
α
)
still changes witha
⊥
anda
z
.  A resonance can be induced
when these two parameters are tuned to some particular
values.
For the case witha
s
>0, the effective potentialV
eff
(z
α
)
given by Eq.  (20) is always positive.  I.e.,V
eff
(z
α
) is a
potential barrier.  In this case the appearance of the res-
onance  seems  to  be  counter-intuitive.   Nevertheless,  in
practice, for 1D scattering a zero-energy even-wave res-
onance really can occur for a potential barrier which is
always  positive.   As  an  example,  we  consider  the  scat-
tering of a particle on a square potential barrier in the
z-axis,  as shown in Fig. 5(a).  The Hamiltonian of this
system is

withW(z) =g

for|z|≤b/2 andW(z) = 0 for|z|> b/2
(b >0) (Fig. 5(a)).  A direct calculation show that the

we havea

resonance can occur under this condition.
Therefore, similar as in the case ofa

s

a even-wave CIR can always appear when the mass ratio
m
α
/m
β
is so large that the intensitya

eff
(z

) is
strong enough and the confinement CLsa
z

are
tuned to some particular values, no matter how small is
a

itself.
To conclude, the above analysis show that the “exotic
CIRs” of our system mainly result from the following two
facts.  First,  the effective potentialV
eff
(z
α
) depends on
the  ratioa/μ,  which  is  essentially  because  the  Huang-
Yang pseudo potentialVis proportional toa/μ.  Second,
an  even-wave  resonance  can  always  occur  for  a  finite-
range 1D potential, no matter if it is an potential well or
a potential barrier.
IV.  SUMMARY
In  this  work  we  study  the  low-energy  scattering  be-
tween the atomαmoving in a quasi-1D confinement and
the localized atomβ.  We show that whenm
α
m
β
two
“exotic”  CIRs  can  appear  even  if  the  3D  inter-atomic
scattering lengtha
s
is much smaller than the CLs of the
confinements,  for eithera
s
>0 ora
s
<0.  With these
two CIRs one can realize strong effective inter-atomic in-
teraction even if the 3D background interaction between
these two atoms is very weak, and thus realize a strongly-
interacting impurity system without the help of MFR. So
far the mixture of ultracold atoms with different masses
has been realized by many experimental groups, e.g, the
mixtures of
173(4)
Yb-
7
Li[36],
161
Dy-
40
K [37] and
40
K-
6
Li[38–40].  Our proposal is very hopefully to be realized
in these experimental systems.
In the future works we will try to find this kind of “ex-
otic” CIRs, which can appear for smalla
s
and is broad
enough for experimental control, in more types of confine-
ments.  As shown in Sec.  I, they could be very useful for
quantum simulations and precision measurements, espe-
cially the ones which are based on spin-dependent inter-
atomic interaction and should be performed at very low
magnetic field orB= 0.

Appendix A: Calculation of Even-Wave Scattering Length for Quasi-(1+0)D System
In this appendix, we present the detailed calculation of the even-wave scattering lengtha
e
defined in Eq.(12) of the
main text.  As mentioned in our main text, our approach is same as our previous work Ref.  [21], where we performed
this calculation for the equal-mass case withm
α
=m
β
.  Since the calculation method is introduced in detail in Ref.
[21], here we only show the basic idea of this method and the formulas which are different from the ones in the the
equal-mass case.
As shown in Ref.  [21], the scattering wave function Ψ
(+)
(ρ,z
α

) introduced in Sec.  II. A satisfies the Lippmann-
Schwinger type equation

Solving Eq.(A4), one could obtainη(z) and hence the scattering state Ψ

(ρ,z

).  Subjecting to the out-going
boundary condition in Eq.(11), one could find the even-wave scattering amplitude as follows

In the zero momentum limit, the even-wave scattering amplitude can be written as

;(A6)
Therefore, if we can obtain the functionη(z), we can obtain the even-wave scattering lengtha
e
via Eq.(A5) and
Eq.(A6).  To this end, we need to re-write Eq.  (A4) as an integral equation forη(z).  As in Ref.  [21], we first re-express
the Green’s function as

[24]  So far the control of spin-spin interaction is only experi-
mentally realized via the CIR of
173
Yb atoms atB= 0,
benefiting from the uncommonly large background value
ofa
s
as mentioned above. With the help of the CIR which
satisfies the conditions (i) and (ii) of Sec. I, one may real-
ize this control for many types of alkali and alkali-earth
(like)  atoms,  with  various  kinds  of  spin  structures  and

Abstract. We train artificial neural networks to distinguish the geometric phases of a set of bands in 1D 
photonic  crystals.  We  find  that  the  trained  network  yields  remarkably  accurate predictions of  the 
topological  phases  for 1D photonic  crystals,  even for the geometric and  material parameters that are 
outside  of the range of  the  trained  dataset.  Another  remarkable  capability  of  the  trained  network  is  to 
predict the boundary of topological transition in the parameter space, where a large portion of trained data 
in the vicinity of that boundary is excluded purposely. The results indicate that the network indeed learns 
the very essence of the structure of Maxwell’s equations, and has the ability of predicting the topological 
invariants beyond the range of the training dataset. 
Introduction. Recent achievements in machine learning including the neural network (NN) have triggered 
considerable attention of  applying  NN to  solve practical  engineering  problems [1–6],  as  well  as  hard 
problems in the field of optics and photonics [7–15]. For example, inverse design problems in optics and 
photonics  often  require  a  lot  of  tedious  optimization  calculations  and  NN  can  be  more  efficient. Some 
recent work succeeded in using NN to achieve the reverse design of nanostructures, including the design 
of meta-surfaces [7], multilayer nanoparticles [8] and multilayer thin films [9]. In addition, NN has also 
been utilized to solve the inverse design problem of topological photonics [11,12]. These NN based works 
show  higher  accuracy  and  time-efficiency  than  that  of  conventional  procedures.  The  high  prediction 

 
2 
accuracy can be interpreted as an advanced interpolation function implemented by NN, which works well 
within the parameter space of the training dataset. Such high accurate predictions can be of great help for 
the photonic design and engineering, if the high prediction accuracy can be extended beyond the training 
dataset. 
A few attempts of predicting physical quantities beyond the training dataset have been made in the context 
of  condense  matter  physics,  with emphasis  on  the  classifications  of  the  topological  order  or  phase 
transitions [16–25]. For instance, Zhang et al. managed to train NN to predict the larger winding numbers 
beyond the training data set in one-dimensional (1D) modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, by feeding 
the  NN  with parameterized  Hamiltonian [16].  The  same  concept  is  also  extended  to a four-band  1D 
problem, as  well  as a two-band 2D  problem [17],  where  the  associated  topological  invariants  (Chern 
numbers) are examined. In addition, the ground state wave functions are also used directly as the training 
data to predict quantum phase transition [18,19]. Notably, the aforementioned works are mainly confined 
to simplified models, where the tight binding approximation is valid. It is interesting and relevant to ask 
whether the capability of extrapolating the topological order in condense  matter physics system can be 
extended to photonic system that is beyond the tight binding approximation. 
In this paper, we examine the predication capability of NN for photonic structures, with the input encoded 
with the structure of Maxwell’s equations in momentum space. As a nontrivial example, we manage to 
use convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the topological invariant of 1D photonic crystal (PC) 
for geometric configurations which lie outside the parameter space of the training dataset.  Importantly, 
the CNN can detect the boundaries of the topological transitions in the parameter space. 
Photonic crystal and neural network. As shown in Fig. 1(a), we consider an AB layered PC with the unit 
cell marked by yellow dotted lines. The dielectric constant of A(B) layer is 휀
푎
(휀
푏
), and the thickness of 
A(B) layer is 푑
푎
(푑
푏
). The lattice constant Λ=푑
푎
+푑
푏
 is fixed throughout this work. Figure 1(b) shows 
the  dispersion of  the lowest  four  bands (solid  lines)  calculated using  the transfer  matrix  method 
(TMM) [26,27]. As the system has inversion symmetry, the geometric Zak phase [28] of each Bloch band 
is either 0 or π, with a corresponding winding number of 0 or 1. We calculate the Zak phases of the bands 
and label each band with its winding number. As for the lowest four bands considered in this paper, the 
four-binary-number  labeling  is  translated  into  a  decimal  integer, e.g., 1011 in Fig.  1(b)  to 11 for 
convenience of the one-hot labeling of the output of the CNN.

To train the NN to learn the underlying principle as governed by the Maxwell’s equations as well as the 
structural and material characteristics of the PCs, we feed the CNN with the Hamiltonian of PC and mine 
the topological information from the input data so that it can potentially predict the topological invariants 
of PCs. The plane wave method (PWM) [29,30] is utilized to generate Hamiltonian of photonic crystals 
with 푚
퐻
 plane waves used in the truncated basis. The value of 푚
퐻
=61 is carefully selected to balance 
the numerical errors of PWM as well as the size of input data of NN. Detailed comparison with TMM can 
be found in section II of Supplementary Materials [31]. With the 11 sampled Bloch 푘-vectors, i.e., 푛
퐾

11, the size of the input Hamiltonian for one PC within the Brillouin zone is

, where the 
last dimension 푐표푙=2 represents the real and imaginary parts of Hamiltonian. 
Given the  input  Hamiltonians (consisting a rank-4  tensor 
[

)  and  binary  labelling,  we 
proceed to study the architecture of CNN to realize the machine predication of topological transitions in 
PCs. As a simple example shown in Fig. 2, we consider the CNN workflow containing two convolutional 
layers (CLs) and two fully-connected layer (FLs). The two CLs contain 푁
퐶1
 and 푁
퐶2
 kernels of size [2,3,3] 
respectively,  as  well  as  a  max-pooling  operation  with  size  [1,2,2], and  the two FLs have 푁
퐹1
 and 푁
퐹2
 
neurons with 푁
퐹2
=16 as the output layer has 16 neurons. The one-hot encoding output is a rank-1 tensor 
with  shape  [16],  which  has  one-to-one  correspondence  to  the  binary  labelling.  For  instance, 11 is 
represented as that only  the 12th neuron of the output is 1 while others are 0. In principle, more layers 
could be used to train the network to obtain a better performance.

Preparation  of  datasets  and  network  training. Next, we  discuss  the  preparation  of  the  datasets,  the 
parameter  space  of  which  has  three  degrees  of  freedom  (DOFs)  (휀
푎
,휀
푏
,푑

),  as  shown  in Fig.  3(a).  To 
guarantee  the  numerical  accuracy  of  PWM, i.e.,  avoiding  the  band  crossing  and  small  bandgap,  two 
constraints to the range of the parameter space are imposed, i.e., 휀
푎

+0.5 and 0.1≤푑
푎
/Λ≤0.9. In 
Fig. 3(a), the parameter space is divided into four sectors, corresponding to four datasets labelled as Train-
1(Train-2), Test-1, Test-2 and Test-3. The parameter range of each dataset is indicated in Fig. 3(a) (see 
Supplementary Materials, section I for details of the four datasets [31]). As an example, Fig.3(b) shows 
the distribution of the labelling in one training dataset, plotted  as functions of 푑
푎
 and 휀
푎
 for the 휀
푏
=2 
plane within the Train-1 dataset. The six colors of the solid circles represent the six labels defined in Fig. 
1(b), corresponding to the following six cases 1–0001, 5–0101, 7–0111, 9–1001, 11–1011, 15–1111. Each 
case has 600 randomly distributed samples and there are three planes (휀
푏
=1,2,3) within Train-1, leading 
to 10800 (=600×6×3) samples in total for Train-1 dataset. The five solid lines (푇
1

) in Fig. 3(b) 
are the boundaries separating different labels determined using TMM. The five solid lines calculated using 
TMM  perfectly  match  the  borders  of the six  different  colors calculated  using PWM, showing  that  the 
TMM and PWM give consistent results of winding numbers for the lowest four bands. To examine the 
capability  and possibility of  our proposed CNN,  we  conceive  a  different  training  dataset, i.e., Train-2 
dataset, which is identical to Train-1 dataset except that a portion of samples in the neighborhood of the 
푇
3
 line (black dashed line) is omitted purposely as shown in Fig. 3(c). The fraction of the omitted data in 
Fig. 3(c) is 푟=0.5, which is defined as the width of 푟푑
푇
 of the omitted data divided by the difference of

Once the CNN is set up, one just need to feed NN with the training data including both Hamiltonian and 
binary  labelling. For  self-testing  purpose,  each  training  dataset  is  separated  into  two  subsets,  70%  for 
training  and  30%  for  testing.  We  follow  the  standard  routine  of  supervised  learning  to  train  the 
network [32–34], i.e., running the learning and testing procedure simultaneously and iteratively until the 
desired  accuracy  is  fulfilled,  which  can  be  saved  and  used  to  predict  topological  transitions with 
parameters outside the training dataset.  
Predicting  the  topological  transitions  beyond the database. As  the  first  example,  we  use  the  dataset 
Train-1 to  train  the  network,  which  consists  of  three  CLs  with [푁
퐶1
,푁
퐶2
,푁
퐶3
]=[10,20,20],  and  three 
FLs  with [푁
퐹1
,푁
퐹2
,푁
퐹3
]=[300,100,16]. The  trained  network  is  used  to  predict  the boundaries of  the 
parameter space (for examples, the 푇
1
 ~ 푇
5
 lines in Fig. 3(b)), where the topological transition occurs. For 
a given 휀
푎
, the predicted phase transition points (the critical values 푑
푐푛푛
 at which the transition occurs) is 
obtained by scanning 푑
푎
 and taking the mean value of two adjacent 푑
푎
 with different Zak phases. To avoid 

 
6 
numerical  instability,  such  calculations of  the  trained  CNN are repeated  10  times  with  different 
initialization conditions. We take the mean value 푑
푐푛푛
̅̅̅̅̅̅
 of these 10 푑
푐푛푛
 as the predicted results, and the 
standard deviation is treated as error. The topological transition lines within Train-1 dataset predicted by 
the well-trained CNN in the 휀
푏
=2 plane are shown by open circles with error bars in Fig. 4(a) with purple 
background. We  see that  the  size  of  open  circles can  already  cover  the  error  bar,  indicating  that  the 
predicted  results  obtained  from  the  well-trained  CNN  are  stable.  For  comparison, we  also  plot  the 
topological transition lines calculated by TMM in the 휀
푏
=2 plane, as shown by solid lines in Fig. 4(a). 
The  excellent  agreement  between  TMM  and  CNN  shows  the  well-trained  CNN  can  reproduce the five 
topological phase transitions within the training dataset.

To demonstrate the predication capability of the network, we use the trained CNN by dataset Train-1 to 
predict four-band-Zak-phase labeling and associated phase transitions in datasets Test-1, Test-2 and Test-
3. In  doing so,  we  are  extrapolating  to  parameter  values  outside  the  training  datasets. Figure 4(a) with 
yellow background shows a comparison of the predicted transition line (open circles) and TMM results 
(solid lines) for constant 휀
푏
=2 within Test-1. The relatively low error of CNN results, which is less than 
10
−3
, shows high predication accuracy and stability beyond the range of the training data. Evidently, the 
predication of dataset Test-1, Test-2 and Test-3 is not a simple interpolation of the topological invariant 
of Train-1, due to the fact that the Test-1 dataset is outside the range of training data, as shown in Fig. 
3(a). The remarkable agreement between TMM and CNN shows that our network indeed encodes some 
characteristics  of Maxwell’s  equation from  the  input data  and captures  the  essence  of  topological 
properties of photonic bands of different PCs.

To further evaluate the prediction accuracy of our network, we consider the relative prediction error of the 
topological  transitions  of  our  network with  reference  to TMM  analytical  results defined  as  퐸

by  CNN  (TMM).  In Fig.  4(b),  the  relative  errors  for  datasets Train-1, Test-1, Test-2 and Test-3 as a 
function  of  five transition  surfaces are  plotted  by  squares,  circles,  inverted  triangles  and  triangles, 
respectively. Evidently, the predication of topological phase transitions is very accurate, with the mostly 
error less than 10
−3
. The prediction error 퐸
푟
 of Test-2 and Test-3 test datasets are apparently less than that 
of Test-1. This somewhat surprising result is due to the well-known truncation errors intrinsic to the PWM 
photonic  crystal with  a large index  contrast  between  its  constituent  components  (see Supplementary 
Materials, section II [31]). 
Prediction  of  unknown  transitions. We now examine  the  performance  of the CNN trained using  a 
different  dataset Train-2,  where  the  samples in  the  neighborhood  of one  of  the  transition lines (푇
3
)  are 
removed. This width of the region of missing data is controlled by a parameter r, as illustrated by the white 
region in Fig. 3(c). The architecture of CNN used here is similar to but slightly more complex than the 
one trained by Train-1,  and it contains three CLs with [푁

푐3
]=[24,32,48] and three FLs with 
[푁
푙1
,푁

]=[500,300,16]. We train the CNN based on the Train-2 dataset with 푟=0.2 and apply it 
on the four datasets. Figure 5(a) shows the phase transition lines 푇

 predicted by CNN (open circles) 
and calculated by TMM (solid lines) in the 휀

in  the 휀

different range within the Train-2 (Test-2) dataset and the white color indicate the parameter space with 
omitted data. Remarkably, the predicted transition lines associated with 푇

 using our network agree 
quite  well  with  the  theoretical  ones  by  TMM,  especially  accurate  predication  of 푇

 transition  line 
highlighting the extrapolation capability of our network. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the predicted results for 
the other three test datasets are also fairly good. Figure 5(c) shows that the relative errors 퐸
푟
 of the phase 
transition  surfaces calculated  by  the  trained  CNN  based  on Train-2 with 푟=0.2 (see Supplementary 
Materials, section IV [31]). As expected, 퐸
푟
 at 푇

 is the largest, and the error is still quite small. 

 
8 
The overall extrapolation capability of our network can be seen in Fig. 5(d) from the relative error of the 
푇
3
 transition surface for the four datasets, as the fraction 푟 of the omitted training data varies. The relative 
errors associated with the predicted transition surfaces in Test-2 and Test-3 datasets are smaller than those 
in Test-1. As  expected,  the  training  error  is  relatively  small  for smaller value  of 푟.  As 푟 increases,  the 
relative error of the overall predicted transition surface will increase. Thus, the extrapolation capability of 
the same CNN structure is compromised, due to the fact that more data are omitted.

Discussion. Through the training of CNN and the prediction results of Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, we can see that 
CNN has an excellent interpolation ability and a reasonably good extrapolation capability in learning the 
critical conditions of geometric phase transition. Since we use the phase transitions predicted based on the 
Hamiltonian obtained by PWM to match that of the TMM, the error between PWM and TMM should be 
taken into account. In Fig. S3 (see Supplementary Materials, section II [31]), we can see that the relative 
error 퐸
푟
푝
 between PWM and TMM of the same dataset decreases from 푇
1
 to 푇
5
, which is in line with the 
trend of the error 퐸
푟
 in Fig. 4(b). Moreover, the error 퐸
푟
푝
 is of the same order of magnitude as 퐸
푟
 in Fig. 

 
9 
4(b), indicating that the error from CNN is small. We also note that the performance of Test-2 and Test-3 
is better than that of Test-1. This is due to the fact that a larger contrast between 휀
푎
 and 휀
푏
 will bring a 
larger truncation error to the PWM for a fixed number of plane waves. It can be further seen that in the 
case  where  there  is  a  boundary  in  the  training  set  that  does  not  specify  a  certain  phase  change,  the 
performance of the CNN is still acceptable when 푟 is small. As the ratio 푟 of the omitted training set is 
larger, the information content will be fewer. For a higher 푟, the error of prediction will be larger for the 
same CNN architecture (see Supplementary Materials, section IV [31]). This problem can potentially be 
mitigated by using a more complex network structure. 
Based  on  the  above  CNN  analysis,  we  can  see  the good learning  ability  of  CNN for topological  phase 
transition in 1D photonic crystals. The network is basically performing a pattern recognition in k space. 
As  the Hamiltonian  contains  the structural and  material information  of PCs as  well  as the Fourier 
transformed Maxwell  equation, its ability is  not  limited  to  the  first  four  bands.  It can  be  extended  to 
topological phase transitions for higher bands and the technique can be applied to 2D PCs or other complex 
structures to predict more physical characters with higher efficiency and accuracy.

It is commonly accepted that a collection of pumped atoms without a resonator, which provides 
feedback, cannot lase. We show that intermodal coupling via active atoms pulls the frequencies 
of the free-space modes towards the transition frequency of the atoms. Although at a low pump 
rate mode phases randomly fluctuate, phase realizations at which interference of pulled modes is 
constructive emerge. This results in an increase of stimulated emission into such realizations and 
makes their lifetime longer. Thus, mode pulling provides positive feedback. When the pump rate 
exceeds a  certain  threshold, the  lifetime  of  one  of  the  realizations  diverges,   and  radiation  
becomes coherent. 
 
Introduction. –    Radiation  of  a  collection  of  incoherently  pumped  atoms in a  cavity-free 
system is usually referred   to as amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) or superfluorescence [1]  . 
It    takes  place in  various  physical systems  –    from  so-called  cosmic  lasers  to  superluminescent 
diodes  [2-  8]  .  In  such  a  system,   a  photon spontaneously  emitted  by  one  of  the  excited  atoms 
triggers  stimulated  emission  of  inverted  atoms  located  on the path  out  of  the  system  [1]  .  Thus,  
ASE is a result of an interplay of stimulated and spontaneous emission, in contrast to lasing that 
occurs due to stimulated emission. Nevertheless, both phenomena have some common features. 
First, in both  laser  and  ASE  systems,   line narrowing  of  output  radiation is  observed. 
Second, similar  to  lasing,  the ASE intensity  output  has  an S-  shaped  dependence  on  the  pump 
rate. These features arise due to nonlinear amplification of radiation. In lasers, a resonator turns 
an amplifier  into  a  generator making radiation coherent.  It  is  commonly  believed  that  a  cavity-

2 
 
free system cannot generate coherent radiation. In other words, an ASE system can only serve as 
an incoherent light source or as a light amplifier (see for detail Ref. [ 9]  ). 
In  this  paper,  we  show  that  even  without  a  cavity,  there  is  a  mechanism  for  creating 
positive  feedback,  in  ASE  systems.  This  mechanism  arises  due  to  the interaction  of  free  space  
modes  with  pumped  atoms.   This  interaction  changes  the density  of  states  (DOS)  of  relevant  
modes of the environment. 
We  consider  a  collection  of  pumped  atoms  surrounded by  free  space.  The free  space  is 
modeled  by  a  one-dimensional multi-mode optical waveguide.  By  computer  simulation,  we 
demonstrate that free-space  modes  indirectly  interact  via  inverted atoms.   This  interaction  is  
responsible for frequency pulling, in  which  frequencies of free space modes are attracted to the 
transition frequency of the atoms of the active medium. This results in a maximum of the DOS at 
the  transition  frequency.  Although near the  maximum,  the  mode  frequencies  are  close,  their 
phases  fluctuate  because  these  modes  are  supported  by  spontaneous  emission.  Nevertheless,  
some sets  of  phases  that lead  to  constructive  interference in  the  modes  emerge. In  such  a  
fluctuation,  the  modes  take  away  the  energy  from  the  pumped  atoms  more  efficiently,  and the 
fluctuation has  a  greater  lifetime.  We  find  the  parameters  of  a cavity-free  system  for which the 
lifetime  of  such  fluctuations  may diverge,   and  the stimulated  emission  of  the  inverted  atoms  
results in s elf-oscillations ( lasing). 
 
The model  and main equations.  – In  a  typical  experiment  on  ASE,   a  large  volume  is 
usually filled with active atoms.  Only a fraction of these atoms within a region stretched in one 
direction  is  pumped.  Assuming  that  the  transverse dimensions  of  the  volume  are  much  smaller  
than  the  longitudinal,   we,  for  simplicity,  consider  a  one-dimensional  multimode  waveguide  
extended  in  the  x-direction.  To make  this  model closer  to  a  real  ASE  experiment,  we  take  into  
account the  radiation  losses  in  the  1D  waveguide  walls  that  correspond  to  losses  through  side  
boundaries of the stretched 3D region.   
In  order  to  quantize  the  electromagnetic  (EM)  field, we  first  consider  a  finite  system, 
bounded by  ideally  reflecting  walls  separated  by  a  very  large  distance 
U
L
  acting  as  the  size  of  
the universe. We then let 
U
L
 ( and consequently the round-trip time 
UU
tL  /c=
) tend to infinity.  
We  expand  the  field  operator  over the  basis  of  creation  and  annihilation  operators  of  the  
waveguides  modes,

The pumped atoms are considered as two-level systems (TLSs), occupying a finite interval,

 (see Sec. 1 of the SM). Our 
estimations show that the reflection of waves at the boundary of the ensemble is so small that it 
does not affect the spatial distribution of the field (see Sec. 3 of the SM). Thus, the system may 
be considered as a cavity-free system. Since the atoms occupy a finite space interval, in the limit 
U
L
→∞
, the geometry of the system becomes typical for ASE. 
In most ASE experiments, even in a subwavelength volume, the number of atoms is  very 
large. In  our  consideration,  to  limit  the  number  of  equations,  non-inverted  atoms  outside  of  the  
stretched region are replaced with vacuum. Such a replacement does not increase reflection at the 
boundaries of the active medium (see Sec. 3 of the SM) and cannot cause lasing associated with 
this reflection.  Losses  in  the  removed  non-inverted  atoms  are  modeled  with  losses  in  the  
waveguide walls. 
Even though only a fraction of all atoms is pumped, their number is still large. This allows 
us  to  divide  the  whole  volume  into  cells  of  the  size  
/ 10
TLS
λ
  and consider operators  averaged  
over the cells. Following the method of the system size expansion [12], we consider the inverse 
number of atoms in a cell, 
1/

system in  the  limit

  order terms.  In  this  limit,  the  expected  
values of operators grow with 
c

 faster than quantum corrections to these expected values [12]. 
Therefore,  in  the  leading  of 
1/

  order, the  system can  be  described  by  equations  for  c-
numbers,  while in the second order of 
1/

noise [13]. These equations are given below and are derived in Sec. 1 of the SM:

The last term,

,  in Eq. (3) describes classical δ-correlated noises (their correlation functions 
are given in Sec. 1 of the SM).   The existence of these noise terms is essential for the description 
of ASE  because  the  latter  arises due  to  spontaneous  emission  of  inverted  atoms.  Indeed,  unlike 
stimulated radiation, which can be considered as a forced evolution of an excited atom under the 
action  of  a  classical  field,  spontaneous  radiation  is  a  quantum  phenomenon  associated  with  an 
exit of  an  atom  from  a  stationary  excited state  without  external  influence.  In  order  to  describe  
this probabilistic process in the framework of regular equations, it is necessary to introduce noise 
[10].  The second  random  process included  in

  is  connected  with  incoherent  pumping.  In  
Eq.  (3),  both  processes  are described  simultaneously  via  the interaction  with  a  pump  reservoir  
with  negative  temperature.  Averaging  over  the  variables  of  this  reservoir  brings  the  terms  
proportional to the pump rate

 and the noise terms into equations.

First,  we make  sure  that  the  system  of  Eqs.  (2)  -(4) can  describe  a  typical  behavior  of  an  
ASE (see, e.g.  [7,8]).   For  the system  with  the length  of  the  active  medium

 is  the gain coefficient in the active medium (the number of atoms in a

Pcomp
γγ=
, 
losses  are  greater  than  the  energy  pumped  into  the  system  and the  amplitudes  of  the  waves 
transmitted  through  the  active  medium  diminish.  Consequently,  the  intensity  of  the EM  field  
reaches a maximum at the center of the active region [1].  Above 
comp
γ
, the transmitted waves are 
intensified, and the maxima of the EM field appear near the edges of the active region [ 1]  . Above 
the compensation threshold, 
Pcomp

, t  he dependence of the intensity of the output EM field on 
the  pump rate has an S-  shape  [1]  .  The inflection point  of  the  curve  is  usually  considered  as the 
ASE-threshold,

 [ 1]  . This behavior is characteristic for ASE. 
To  characterize  coherent  properties  of  light,   we  employ  the  second-order  coherence

We  have  specially  monitored  the  possibility  of  lasing  due  to  the formation  of  the Fabry-
Perot resonator. Our evaluation shows that in such a resonator, the lasing can never be achieved 
(see Secs. 2 and 3 of the SM). Moreover,  as we show in Secs. 4 and 5 of the SM, the lasing arises 
even in a system having only a single inverted atom. Obviously, in this limiting case, no cavity 
can be formed. 
 
Mechanism  for  the  cavity  free lasing. – As  discussed  in  the  previous  section, our  model  
demonstrates  an unexpected  result  – lasing  in  a cavity-free  ASE  system.  To  understand  this 
effect,  it  is  useful  to  take  a  look  at  the  textbook  picture  of  lasing  in  a  system  with a  resonator 
from a  nonconventional  point  of  view.  An  open  resonator  placed in  free  space  leads to a  local 
maximum in the DOS at the resonance  frequency  [14].  The modes forming the maximum have 
almost the  same  frequencies  and  can  interfere. A  certain  configuration  of  these  modes  interfere 
constructively  increasing the  field  intensity.  Consequently, the  excited  atoms are  stimulated  to  
emit  photons  into  the  configuration  of  the  modes more  intensively,  increasing  the  field  further. 
Thus, the DOS maximum serves as positive feedback providing coherent radiation of the system. 
The lasing is attributed to the DOS maximum generated by a resonator [ 14].  
Below  we  show  that  the  mechanism,   in  which  a  DOS  maximum  provides  positive  
feedback,  can  be  realized  in  a  cavity-free system.  The  main  difference  between  our  mechanism  

7 
 
and the mechanism described in Ref. [14] is that in a cavity-free system, the DOS maximum is 
created by the nonlinear interaction of free-space modes with an active medium.  
The  analysis  shows  that  without  noise  new eigensolutions to  Eqs.  (2)–(4),  hybrids  of  free  
space modes and atomic states are formed.  When the pump rate is near zero, these modes differ 
only slightly from  the  free-space  modes,   but  they have  complex  frequencies. None  of  these  
modes can be obtained as a linear combination of free space modes because each of them has its 
own  frequency  but  is  described  by  the  whole  set  of  wave  vectors  of  free  space  modes.  As  the 
pump rate  increases,  little  happens  to almost  all  modes.  They  change  slightly in shape and 
remain strongly damped. However, for one of the modes, its damping decreases to zero,  and the 
spatial  distribution  tends  to  a  typical  field  distribution  in  an  ASE  system.  The  field  intensity  of  
the solution increases approaching the boundaries of the active medium from within. Outside the 
region  filled  with  the active  medium,  the  intensity  diminishes  due  to  losses  in  the  waveguide  
walls. The  field  intensity  has  a  minimum  in  the  middle  and  maxima  at  the  edges  of  the  active 
region. The frequency of this mode is equal to the atom transition frequency. The phases of the 
spatial harmonics,  forming such a distribution of the field, are fixed. When the pump threshold is 
reached, the imaginary part of the frequency turns to zero, and a Hopf bifurcation arises. A non-
zero  solution  is  a  self-oscillation with  a  transition  frequency  of  the  active  medium.  The 
dependence of the intensity of the state on the pump rate is shown in Fig. 1 by the red line. 
For different pump rates, the distribution of the EM field in this mode is shown in Fig. 2. 
One can see that with an increase in the pump rate, the maxima of the EM field at the boundaries 
of the active medium arise. Consequently, the number of harmonics building the collective mode 
also  increases  (see  SM,  Sec.  2).  In  other  words,  the  number  of  states  with the transition 
frequency increases forming a maximum of DOS.  
Our  computer  simulation  of  the  system  with  noise  shows  that  the  presence  of  an  active  
medium  also  leads  to  a  local  increase  in the DOS  even  if  there  is  no  reflection  from  the 
boundaries between the active medium and the outside space. In this case, the DOS changes due 
to  the  intermodal  coupling  through  atoms.  This  coupling  results  in  pulling  free-space  modes  to 
the transition frequency of the inverted atoms and in the peak in the system DOS.

Note, that the dynamics of mode pulling may only be observed in a system with noise [see 
Eqs.  (2)-(4)].  Indeed,  in  such  a  system,  the  phase of  the  free-space  mode  fluctuates.   Phase 
fluctuations may be presented as fluctuations in frequencies. Since at the transition frequency of 
active atoms the gain coefficient has a maximum, the closer to the transition frequency the mode 
frequency  is,  the  slower  is  the  mode  decay.  Therefore,  the  longest-living  fluctuations  are  those  
that  pull  the  mode  towards  the  transition  frequency.  Such  fluctuations  give the  greatest 
contribution  to  the  mean  frequency. To  demonstrate  this  frequency  pulling,  we  consider  the 
spectrum  of  each  space  harmonic.  For  this  purpose,  we  calculate  the  values  of  the correlator

frequency (Fig. 3, the green line). This maximum sharply grows with a further rate increase (the 
red  dash-dotted line  in  Fig.  3).  We  refer  to  this  phenomenon  as  the  frequency  pulling  of  space  
harmonics with different wavenumbers.

Due  to  the  frequency  pulling,  the  collective  mode,  which  consists  of  different  space

lasing in the system (see also Ref. [15]).   Despite the absence of the resonator, this is similar to a 
conventional Fabry-Perot laser, in which the maximum of the DOS is created by a cavity [14]. In 
our case, the maximum of the DOS is the result of the nonlinear interaction between modes and 
atoms.

Conclusion. – We have demonstrated that above a coherence threshold, 
coh
γ
,  a cavity-free 
ASE  system  may generate  coherent  light.  The reason  for  coherent  radiation  is  the  pulling of 
frequencies  of  free-space modes  with  different  wavevectors  towards  the  transition  frequency  of  
active atoms. This pulling occurs due to the nonlinear interaction of free-space modes with active 
atoms.   
In  a  noisy  system,  we  observe  the mode  pulling  both  below  and  above  the  coherence  
threshold. Moreover,  the collective mode, which is formed in a long-lived   fluctuation, arises at    a 
pump rate far below the threshold. Such frequency pulling of the free-space EM field toward the 
transition  frequency  of  active atom results  in  a  peak  in  the  DOS of  the  system and  a  sharp 
decrease  in  the  group  velocity  of  light.  This  decrease leads  to  an  increase  in  the  interaction  
strength between the EM field and the active medium [ 15], which ultimately leads to lasing. 
In  a  system  without  noise,  below  the  threshold,  the  mean  value  of  the  stationary  field  is  
zero.  Nonetheless,  a collective mode is being formed by the pulling of free-space harmonics. The 
eigenfrequency of this mode has a  negative imaginary part. The real part of the eigenfrequency is 
almost equal  to  the  atomic  transition  frequency.  Above  the  coherence  threshold,  the  imaginary  
part   of   the eigenfrequency becomes   positive   and   the   system   radiates   coherently.   Thus, 
spontaneous emission is not essential to the formation of the coherently radiated ASE mode. As 
in  a  laser,  spontaneous  emission  acts  as  a  seed  creating  photons  to  initiate  induced  radiation. 
Indeed, in a system without noise, we find a sharp lasing threshold, as shown in Fig. 1.  
Our  analysis  shows  that  the  coherence  threshold cannot  be identified  with the  lasing  
threshold, which may arise due to reflection at the boundaries of an active medium and vacuum. 
To  demonstrate  this,  we  compare  the  DOS  in  our  system  with  the  DOS  in  the  system  with  a  
Fabry-Perot  resonator.  The  comparison  shows  that  in  order  to  obtain  lasing  at  the  coherence 
threshold due to feedback provided by the resonator, the amplitude reflection coefficient should 
be 
0.11

. This is much higher than the reflection from boundaries of an active medium and 
vacuum  which  in  our  system  is

  (see  Sec.  3  of  the  SM).  In  our  system,  the  only  
condition necessary for lasing is a maximum in DOS.
